# Changelog

All notable changes to claude-dev-team. Versions follow semver.

## [1.66.2] — 2026-08-04
### Fixed
The web smoke spec now **actually passes**, verified by running it against a real Chromium and a
conformant server — 9/9 — rather than by inspection. Three prior rounds of fixes were validated only by
reading the code, and each one shipped a spec that could not pass. Reviewers found these by building a
server and running the suite; that is now the bar for this harness.
- **Every deliberately-negative test always failed.** Chromium logs a *second* line for each failing
  request — `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401` — with no URL and no
  `http NNN:` prefix, so no `allowedPageIssues` pattern could target it. The 1.66.1 opt-outs were
  correct and fired; this duplicate line defeated them. It is dropped at source, since the `response`
  handler already records the same event **with** its URL.
- **The upload/download test always failed.** A download is an aborted navigation, and 1.66.1 had
  promoted `requestfailed` to a hard failure — so `net::ERR_ABORTED` failed the test with no opt-out.
  `ERR_ABORTED` is now recorded as evidence, never fatal; every other request failure still fails.
- **CRUD could not pass on a server-rendered app.** `expectPersisted` used `page.reload()`, which on a
  non-PRG app re-submits the create POST — a second row and a strict-mode violation, while appearing to
  prove persistence. It now re-fetches the list with a GET. And `createItem`/`uploadFile` accepted only
  2xx, so a PRG app's 303 was treated as failure; both now accept 2xx-or-3xx.
- **Credential redaction leaked four shapes.** Requiring a separator (the 1.66.1 fix for prose being
  eaten) stopped redacting `Bearer <jwt>`, `token <jwt>`, `Authorization Bearer <jwt>` and
  URL-embedded tokens; `\S+` also stopped at the first space, so `Cookie: a=1; session=<jwt>` leaked the
  second pair; and `\btoken\b` could not match inside `access_token`. Now two branches — separator
  always redacts, whitespace/slash redacts only before a credential-shaped value — with a keyword
  prefix allowed and the value run stopping at `;`/`,`. 14/14 cases correct, prose still untouched.
- `fileURLToPath` instead of `URL.pathname` for the upload fixture, which percent-encodes any path
  containing a space.
- Two e2e assertions asserted `doctor` had *started*, matching its own banner; they now require its
  tally line. Removed an orphaned comment in `hooks/web-qa.sh`.

## [1.66.1] — 2026-08-03
### Fixed
Two fixes in 1.66.0 were wrong in the same way the bug they replaced was wrong: they made the shipped
smoke spec unable to pass. Found by re-review after release.
- **The item-row locator could never match.** 1.66.0 anchored it (`^name$`) to stop a renamed row
  matching its own old name. But a row is a *container* — the flows scope the Edit/Delete buttons
  inside it, so its text content is `My itemEditDelete` and an anchored pattern matches nothing.
  Reverted to a substring match; `renameItem` now **throws** if the new name contains the old one,
  which is the actual precondition, and the smoke spec renames to a non-superstring.
- **Failing on any `>=400` broke three deliberately-negative tests.** A rejected sign-in (401), a
  refused admin route (403 — which `scenarios.md` tells you to *assert*) and a rejected form
  (400/422) are correct behaviour, not defects. The `>=400` rule stays, because it is the stronger
  check; the three tests now opt out narrowly via `allowedPageIssues` in their own `describe`, which
  is also the worked example of how to do that.
- **Console redaction ate ordinary diagnostics.** The separator was optional, so
  `token expired, please sign in` became `token <redacted> please sign in`. It is now required —
  `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` still redacts the JWT.
- **`flows/files.ts` and `expectPersisted()` were dead code** while their `routes.files` and four
  `SelectorName` entries were mandatory, so an already-onboarded app config had to satisfy an
  interface nothing exercised. Both are now used by the smoke spec (23 tests, up from 20).
- `CDT_QA_ALLOW_REMOTE` is documented in `templates/README.md` and `.env.qa.example` — the files
  someone onboarding actually opens — not only in the skill.
- The e2e exit-code assertion ran where no harness existed, so it proved only that the guard fired;
  `exit 0` would have passed it. It now runs against a stub that exits 3 and asserts the 3 survives.
- Removed a dead duplicate directory-in-the-way check in `hooks/web-qa.sh`.

## [1.66.0] — 2026-08-03
### Added
- **Autonomous web QA — one QA engineer, two surfaces.** CDT can now drive a real browser the way it
  drives a device: open the app, run a complete user journey, assert the accessibility tree, and on
  failure capture the trace, video and screenshot, name the root cause, fix, and re-run until green.
  - **`qa-shared` skill — the unification.** The autonomous loop, the `cdt-verify` evidence gate, the
    artifact layout, the failure-analysis format, the report shape, and the credential / payment / PII
    rules are now defined **once** and shared by web and mobile. `web-qa` and `mobile-qa` carry only what
    is genuinely platform-specific — `mobile-qa` was deduplicated against it in the same change, not
    just pointed at it, so there is one copy of each rule rather than two that drift apart.
  - **`web-qa` skill** — Playwright control-plane precedence (MCP → `cdt-web-qa` → raw `npx playwright`),
    cross-browser guidance, and playbooks for the eleven flows that actually break: authentication,
    role-based access, forms, CRUD, search/filter/sort, upload/download, payment, API errors, responsive,
    cross-browser, and session/permission. Auto-applies from the orchestrator's routing table and the
    `qa-engineer` / `frontend-engineer` contracts.
  - **`cdt-web-qa` CLI** — `doctor` · `browsers` · `artifacts` · `scaffold` · `test` · `trace`. Thin
    wrappers over `npx playwright`; `doctor` gates first and reports honestly when no browser engine is
    installed rather than inventing a pass.
  - **Shared Playwright harness** (`cdt-web-qa scaffold`) — one framework serving many apps, with
    chromium/firefox/webkit projects, `storageState` role reuse, and per-app config. Same shape as the
    Appium harness: shared flows stay app-agnostic and an incomplete app config fails to compile.
  - **Assertions are DOM- and accessibility-based, never image-based.** Locators follow
    `getByRole()` → `getByLabel()` → `getByText()` → `data-testid`; XPath and coordinate clicks are a
    documented last resort. Screenshots are evidence for humans, not a validation method.
  - **Console and network are first-class signals.** A page that renders correctly but logged a JS error
    or a failed/5xx request is a **failure**, not a pass — checked every scenario.
  - No new MCP server: **Playwright MCP was already a CDT plugin dependency**, so browser control needed
    no new plumbing — only the QA brain that drives it.

### Changed
- **Artifacts are unified at `<repo>/.claude/qa/<platform>/<runid>`** with `CDT_QA_ARTIFACTS` honoured by
  both CLIs, so a web run and a device run land side by side under one reporting root.
  `CDT_MQA_ARTIFACTS` is still honoured for back-compat, and `.gitignore` now covers `**/.claude/qa/`.

## [1.65.0] — 2026-08-03
### Added
- **Autonomous mobile QA.** CDT can now drive a real Android device or emulator the way a QA engineer
  does: install and launch the app, run a user scenario end to end, and — on failure — capture the
  screenshot, video, and logcat, name the root cause, fix, and re-run until green. It plugs into the
  existing Task Loop, so a mobile "pass" is held to the same evidence gate as every other claim.
  - **`mobile-qa` skill** — the loop, the control-plane precedence (a wired mobile **MCP** first, then
    `cdt-mobile-qa`, then raw `adb`), and playbooks for the eight flows that actually break: login/logout,
    form submission, navigation, CRUD, API errors, payment, offline, and permissions. Auto-applies — it is
    in the orchestrator's skill-routing table and in the `qa-engineer` / `mobile-engineer` contracts, so
    device work routes to it without being asked.
  - **`cdt-mobile-qa` CLI** — `doctor` · `devices` · `install` · `launch` · `stop` · `reset` · `shot` ·
    `record` · `ui` · `logcat` · `net` · `perm` · `artifacts` · `appium` · `scaffold`. Thin wrappers over
    `adb`; `doctor` runs first and reports honestly when no device is attached, rather than inventing a pass.
  - **Shared Appium + UiAutomator2 harness** (`cdt-mobile-qa scaffold`) — one WebdriverIO framework that
    serves many apps: shared flows stay app-agnostic and each app contributes a config with its own test
    ids. React Native and Ionic Capacitor are both handled, including the WebView context switch Capacitor
    needs. Selectors bind to accessibility ids / `resource-id` / `content-desc`; XPath only as a documented
    last resort.
  - No new MCP server was written — the existing `appium-mcp-server` and `@mobilenext/mobile-mcp` are
    registered and routed to, and the ADB CLI is the fallback when neither is wired.
  - Guardrails that are not optional: credentials from env only, payment flows against **sandbox only**,
    and artifacts gitignored (screenshots and logcat carry PII and tokens).

### Security
Found by the security review before release; each is reproduced by a test in `scripts/e2e.sh`, and every
guard below was mutation-tested (remove it, the suite goes red) so the tests cannot pass vacuously.
- **`scaffold` refuses a project root, even with `--force`.** Scaffolding onto a repo root overwrote the
  app's own `package.json` and `.gitignore` — and replacing the `.gitignore` un-ignored the app's real
  `.env`, staging live secrets for commit. The harness owns a subdirectory: `scaffold --dir <repo>/qa`.
- **`artifacts --clean` can no longer delete outside the artifacts root.** It matched `*/mobile-qa/*` as a
  substring, so any project directory with a `mobile-qa` path segment was `rm -rf`-able. Now a real
  containment check against the resolved root.
- **Package, permission and activity names are charset-validated before reaching `adb shell`.** `adb`
  joins argv into one string that the device's `sh` re-parses, so local quoting was not enough — a name
  like `com.x;rm -rf /sdcard` would have run both halves on the device. Validation runs *before* device
  resolution, so it is enforced (and testable) whether or not a device is attached.
- **The artifacts directory now ignores itself.** `artifacts_dir()` writes a `.gitignore` containing `*`
  into the artifacts root on creation, so captures are uncommittable in **any** repo — including one that
  was never scaffolded, and a custom `CDT_MQA_ARTIFACTS` pointing outside the repo. A repo-level rule
  (`**/.claude/mobile-qa/`, also added here) cannot cover those cases on its own.
  **Caveat:** this does not retroactively untrack captures already committed by an earlier run — if you
  ran a pre-1.65.0 build, check `git log` for `.claude/mobile-qa/` and purge as needed.
- **`scaffold` identifies a harness by fingerprint, not by sniffing for project markers.** Checking for
  `.git`/`package.json` was whack-a-mole and blind to the primary target: a Gradle Android module inside a
  monorepo has neither, so `--force` there destroyed the module and replaced its `.gitignore`, exposing
  `local.properties` (keystore password). `--force` now requires the target to *be* a harness
  (`wdio.conf.ts` + `apps/types.ts`) — which also keeps `--force` working after onboarding, where the app's
  own `apps/<id>.ts` and `.env.qa` are expected rather than foreign.
- **An existing `.gitignore` is never overwritten — including under `--force`.** Losing the harness's
  ignore rules is recoverable; leaking a key is not.
- **Templates are unlinked before copying.** `cp` follows a symlink and writes *through* it, so a link
  named like a template could clobber a file outside the target directory.
- **`scaffold` fails loudly on a partial copy** instead of printing a success line and exiting 0, and
  `install`/`reset` parse `Success` from adb's output rather than trusting an exit code that has
  historically been 0 on failure.
- **`ui` clears the previous dump before capturing** and verifies it is non-empty — a stale UI tree read
  as fact is a fabricated observation. **`logcat --pkg`** no longer hides an adb failure behind a
  pipeline's exit status on the app-crashed path. **`appium stop`** kills the process group and verifies
  the server actually died, rather than killing `npx` and claiming success.
- **MCP servers are pinned, not `@latest`.** An MCP server has code execution in your session *and* full
  device control; `npx -y ...@latest` re-resolves from the registry every launch, so a hijacked publish
  would run automatically. The skill now pins both versions and states the third-party risk.

## [1.64.2] — 2026-08-02
### Fixed
- **The mirror of 1.64.1: a stale `failed` status survived a PASSED verdict.** After the fix landed and
  the loop released, `TASK_RESULT.json` still read `{"status":"failed","verification":"passed"}` — the
  reconciliation only ran in the red direction. A green verdict now clears a stale `failed`;
  `blocked` and `needs_review` still survive, since those can be true for reasons a test suite cannot see.
  Found by driving the *installed* build through the full red → fix → green cycle.

## [1.64.1] — 2026-08-02
### Fixed
- **`TASK_RESULT.json` could say `{"status":"done","verification":"failed"}`** — the artifact this whole
  layer exists to prevent, and `status` is the field humans and scripts read first. `finalizeTaskResult`
  overrode a stale result's `verification` but kept its authored `status`, so a `done` written earlier in
  the session survived a verdict that had since gone red. Status is now reconciled against the evidence:
  a FAILED verdict forces `failed` (an already-honest `blocked` is kept), and `not_run` demotes `done` to
  `partial` unless the edits were docs-only. Found by running the shipped 1.64.0 build against a real
  failing command rather than trusting the suite.

## [1.64.0] — 2026-08-02
### Fixed
- **CDT could end a session on "done" with failing tests. The anti-hallucination layer was never running.**
  Four defects, each verified on a real install, that compounded into the reported behavior:
  1. `toolkit/dist/` is **gitignored**, so `git ls-files toolkit/dist` is empty and **no install has ever
     received a built toolkit** — the installed `cdt/1.62.1/toolkit/` had no `dist/` at all. Every guard
     that lives there (`hook.js finalize`, `TASK_RESULT.json`, the final-response format) was silently
     skipped, because the Stop hook guards on `[ -f "$_TKDIST/cli/hook.js" ]`. Remediation was a *warning*
     telling the user to run npm by hand.
  2. `~/.claude/bin/cdt-verify` pointed into a **pruned** version directory (`…/cdt/1.42.0/…`) — a dangling
     symlink. Since `cdt-verify` is the only producer of a real exit code, **nothing could earn
     `verification: passed`**.
  3. The surviving gate matched the verifying command's **string** and recorded `exitCode: null`, so a
     failing `npm test` satisfied it exactly as well as a passing one.
  4. It fired **once per session**, so even a detected problem got one nudge and the session ended anyway.

### Added
- **The bootstrap builds the toolkit** (`npm install --omit=optional`, then `npm run build` as fallback),
  once per installed version, and re-links the CLIs at that version — which is also the dangling-symlink
  heal. Runs before the community gate, so `bootstrap-community off` cannot disable verification.
  Off with `cdt-config bootstrap-toolkit off`. Stale links are dropped at SessionStart rather than left to
  read as "installed" and fail at exec.
- **Verification now means the command PASSED.** The verdict comes from real exit codes in
  `verify-events.jsonl`, floored at the last edit — evidence older than the change describes a build that
  no longer exists. A red verdict **blocks and keeps blocking**.
- **The Task Loop is enforced in code, not prose** (`STEP 3b` was advice the model could skip). Each red
  Stop reports `iteration N/CDT_MAX_ITERATIONS` and the failing commands; an **unchanged failure signature
  twice** escalates to the Bug Council; at the cap it stops blocking but records the session as `BLOCKER`.
  Tune with `cdt-config max-iterations <n>` (default 5).
- **`verify-wrap` (PreToolUse/Bash)** — a bare `npm test` is denied with the exact wrapped command to
  re-issue, so exit codes are actually captured. Never denies when `cdt-verify` is not runnable (denying in
  favour of a broken binary would make the project's test command un-runnable), and never rewrites a
  pipeline, whose exit code is not the one that matters. `cdt-config verify-wrap block|warn|off`.
- **Claim gate** — a final reply asserting "done / fixed / all tests pass" while the recorded verdict is
  red or absent is blocked, quoting the offending sentence and the real verdict. Hedges ("should fix",
  "once the suite passes") and honest failure reports are deliberately not claims.
  `cdt-config claim block|warn|off`.

### Changed
- `computeVerification` takes a `since` floor and decides on the **newest run per command**. The old
  "any failure ever ⇒ failed" was sticky: the run proving a fix was outvoted by the failure that prompted
  it, so the loop could never converge. Per-command also stops a passing `lint` masking a failing `test`.
- Degraded mode preserved: with no toolkit/node, the old marker heuristic still guards the session.
- Tests **+35** (e2e 19 verify-gate/claim/wrap scenarios, toolkit 58 vitest). Mutation-checked: accepting a
  red verdict, ignoring the staleness floor, removing the loop cap, disconnecting the claim gate from the
  evidence, or denying without a runnable `cdt-verify` each turns green scenarios red.

## [1.63.0] — 2026-08-02
### Added
- **The bootstrap now provisions `bun`, so a fresh install stops opening on hook errors.** Every new machine
  showed `SessionStart:startup hook error … Error: Bun not found` twice plus one on `UserPromptSubmit`.
  Cause: CDT bootstraps `claude-mem`, and all six of its hooks shell out to `scripts/bun-runner.js`, which
  **does not self-install** — with no bun on PATH (nor at `~/.bun/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`,
  `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin`) it prints the error and exits 1. The registry claimed
  `bun (auto-installed)`; that was never true. Now `cdt-plugins bootstrap` installs it via
  `brew install oven-sh/bun/bun`, else `npm install -g bun` — **never `curl | sh`**. Skipped when bun already
  resolves at any path `bun-runner.js` searches, skipped when `claude-mem` is absent or disabled, attempted
  **once** per machine (stamped before the shell-out, so a hang cannot loop), and off with
  `cdt-config bootstrap-binaries off`.
- **`permissions.defaultMode` is set to `auto` on first bootstrap.** CDT's dispatch loop stalls when every
  specialist hand-off waits for a permission prompt, and the mode was previously left to each user to find.
  It is written **only when `settings.json` has no explicit value** — any existing choice is never
  overridden — and it is **one-shot**: revert it and it stays reverted. Disable with `cdt-config auto-mode off`.
  Both steps run *before* the community-bundle gate and the nothing-to-do early return, so a machine whose
  plugins are all present still converges.

### Changed
- Registry: `claude-mem`'s `bun (auto-installed)` / `uv (auto-installed)` corrected — bun is a hard
  requirement provisioned by CDT; `uv` stays user-installed. `docs/plugins.md` updated to match.
- Plugin tests **37 → 41**. The four new scenarios were mutation-checked: breaking the never-override guard,
  the invalid-JSON bail-out, the `bun` knob, the one-shot stamp, the `claude-mem` guard, or swapping the npm
  fallback for `curl | sh` each turns a green scenario red.

## [1.62.1] — 2026-08-01
### Fixed
- **Upgrading to 1.62.0 parked CDT in `dependency-unsatisfied`.** Claude Code resolves manifest
  dependencies eagerly on a *fresh* install, but on an *upgrade* it resolves them lazily — so the eight
  dependencies added in 1.62.0 did not arrive, and `claude plugin list` reported
  `Dependency "github@claude-plugins-official" is not installed` against CDT. That state makes a plugin
  disable-eligible, so the bundle release could have disabled CDT for existing users. Reproduced on a real
  upgrade, not inferred.
- **`cdt-plugins bootstrap` now heals every missing row, not just the community pair.** It installs any
  registry row that is absent and not explicitly `disabled` in the overlay, so the bundle converges on the
  upgrade path as well as the fresh-install path. A deliberate `cdt-plugins disable <id>` is still
  respected and never re-installed.

### Changed
- Plugin tests **36 → 37**: the bootstrap case now also asserts a missing *official* dependency is healed,
  and the idempotency fixture is generated from the registry so it covers every installable row.

## [1.62.0] — 2026-08-01
### Added
- **All-in-one install — `claude plugin install cdt` now lands the entire toolchain.** Previously only four
  official companions came along and everything else was opt-in. Now a fresh install brings the bundled
  13 skills / 19 agents / 21 commands, the `sequential-thinking` MCP, **12 official plugins** as manifest
  `dependencies` (adds `playwright`, `github`, `sentry`, `terraform`, `laravel-boost`, and the
  typescript/php/swift LSPs), and the **2 community plugins** via a new bootstrap.
- **`cdt-plugins bootstrap` — acquires `ponytail` + `claude-mem` automatically at SessionStart, without
  prompting.** They *cannot* be manifest dependencies: Claude Code leaves "dependencies from a marketplace
  you have not added" unresolved and **disables the dependent plugin**, and it never auto-adds a
  marketplace — so declaring them would have **disabled CDT itself** on every machine lacking the
  `ponytail` / `thedotmack` marketplaces. The bootstrap runs `marketplace add` first, then `install`.
  It is **idempotent** (stamp + live installed-state check, so an uninstall re-heals), **fail-open**
  (always rc0 — it can never break a session), **bounded** (`CDT_BOOTSTRAP_TIMEOUT`, default 180s per
  shell-out), **async** (never delays startup), and **redacted**.
- `cdt-config bootstrap-community on|off` (default **on**) and `CDT_BOOTSTRAP_TIMEOUT`.

### Changed
- **Every installable registry row is now `enabledByDefault: true`** — the registry describes a bundle, not
  an opt-in menu. The community rows lost their extra "explicitly enabled" routing gate and now behave like
  any other row: a `disabled` overlay is the only thing that silences one.
- Plugin test suite **33 → 36**: bootstrap ordering (`marketplace add` before `install`), the kill switch
  blocking every shell-out, and idempotency. Ordering and kill-switch cases were each verified to **fail
  with their fix reverted**; the idempotency case is guarded by two independent mechanisms, so it is
  defense-in-depth rather than a single-point regression test.

### Notes
- **This installs `claude-mem` on every new machine.** Its `PostToolUse` hook fires on every tool call and
  each observation is a Claude Agent SDK completion **billed to your own usage budget**. Redirect it via
  `~/.claude-mem/.env`, or run `cdt-config bootstrap-community off` before first launch.
- CDT installs plugins but still **provisions no toolchains or credentials**: LSP binaries, Playwright
  browsers, claude-mem's bun/uv, and `github`/`sentry` OAuth remain warn-with-remediation, so a fresh
  machine legitimately shows some `⨯ missing-dep` / `! needs-auth` rows. `doctor` still exits 0 — only the
  four *required* plugins can fail it.

## [1.61.1] — 2026-08-01
### Fixed
- **`cdt-plugins` handed out an install command that could never succeed.** The community rows added in
  1.61.0 live on their own marketplaces (`ponytail`, `thedotmack`), which are not configured by default —
  but the health table's `installed = false` branch was evaluated **before** the `marketplace not
  configured` branch, making the marketplace guard unreachable in exactly the case it exists for. A user
  saw `○ available — install: cdt-plugins install ponytail`, ran it, and hit an unresolvable identifier
  with no hint that a marketplace was missing. The marketplace check now runs first and names the exact
  command. Latent since 1.59.0 — harmless only because every row until now lived on
  `claude-plugins-official`, which is effectively always configured.
- **`cdt-plugins sync` reported *configured* marketplaces as missing.** `has_mkt` reads `MKT_CACHE`, which
  only `cmd_list` primed; `cmd_sync` called `_cache_installed` alone, so every lookup there failed. Sync
  now primes both caches.
- Registry rows gain an optional **`marketplaceSource`** (`owner/repo`) so the tooling can print the exact
  `claude plugin marketplace add …`. CDT never runs it — adding a marketplace stays a user trust decision,
  even under `CDT_PLUGIN_AUTO_INSTALL=1`.

### Changed
- Plugin test suite **30 → 33**: marketplace-precedence, the sync prerequisite, and a regression guard for
  the `MKT_CACHE` bug. Each was verified to **fail with its fix reverted** — case 33 initially passed
  vacuously against an almost-right substring (`not configured` vs the emitted `is not configured`) and was
  corrected until it genuinely caught the regression.
- `docs/plugins.md` documents the marketplace prerequisite, with a troubleshooting row.

## [1.61.0] — 2026-08-01
### Added
- **Community plugin tier in the registry — `ponytail` and `claude-mem` are now first-class rows.** The
  registry grows from 13 to **15 plugins**, and gains a fourth `securityLevel`: **`community-third-party`**,
  for plugins that ship from an **independent marketplace** rather than `claude-plugins-official`
  (`ponytail@ponytail`, `claude-mem@thedotmack`). CDT now detects them, health-checks them, and routes
  around them like any other row — `cdt-plugins list` · `explain <id>` · `doctor` all work unchanged.
- **Opt-in by construction.** Both ship `enabledByDefault: false`, so the shipped defaults change nothing
  for anyone who doesn't want them: they render `○ available` and the advisory router stays silent. Turn one
  on per-machine with `cdt-plugins enable <id>` — the overlay lands in `~/.claude/.cdt/plugins-state.json`
  and survives plugin updates. Their install stays **strict-gated** (only `official` bypasses
  `CDT_PLUGIN_STRICT`), so nothing third-party ever auto-executes.
- **Both defer to CDT — the lane rule holds.** `ponytail` conflicts with `cdt-simplify` (the completion
  mandate owns the simplify step) and `claude-mem` conflicts with `cdt-vault` (`cdt-recall` / `cdt-learn`
  stay authoritative). The router prints them as deferred instead of recommending them, so a community
  plugin can never front-run a CDT agent.
- **Docs:** [`docs/plugins.md`](docs/plugins.md) gains a **Security levels** table, a **Community plugins**
  section covering each plugin's hooks, runtime footprint and knobs, and a **cost note** — `claude-mem`
  fires on every `PostToolUse` and each observation is a Claude Agent SDK completion, which lands on your
  own usage budget unless you point `~/.claude-mem/.env` at a separate backend.

### Fixed
- **`cdt-plugins disable <id>` did not actually suppress a recommendation.** `plib_state_set` persists the
  overlay as a **plain string** (`"disabled"`), but the router's `_mark()` only understood dict and
  boolean-`false` shapes — so a disabled plugin kept being recommended, contradicting the documented
  "the advisory router never recommends a plugin whose overlay is disabled". The string form (the common
  case) is now handled, along with `true`/`"enabled"` for the opt-in set. Regression-tested (case 28).
- **`cdt-plugin-route` ignored `$CDT_PLUGIN_REGISTRY`.** `cdt-plugins` honored the override but the router
  did not, so the two tools could silently disagree about which registry was authoritative. The router now
  mirrors `plib_registry_path()`: explicit override → user copy → shipped default.
- **`cdt-plugin-route` hardcoded `CDT_HOME`,** ignoring an exported override (`plugins-lib.sh` has always
  honored it). Now `${CDT_HOME:-$HOME/.claude}`, which also lets the overlay tests run hermetically instead
  of against the real `~/.claude/.cdt/`.

### Changed
- `config/plugins.json` `meta.note` records that non-official rows are `community-third-party`, opt-in, and
  strict-gated; identifiers re-verified against the `claude plugin` CLI on **Claude Code 2.1.220**.
- Plugin test suite grows **27 → 30** cases, covering overlay-string gating, community-tier silence before
  opt-in, and the defer-to-CDT path after opt-in.

## [1.60.0] — 2026-07-13
### Added
- **No AI attribution on commits or PRs — guaranteed, on every machine CDT runs on.** Your commits get no
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer, your PRs get no `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]` footer, and neither
  carries a `Claude-Session` link. The trailers come from Claude Code itself (it injects the instruction
  when attribution is on), so a `CLAUDE.md` rule or a repo git hook can't guarantee it — CDT therefore
  enforces the only real source of truth, **Claude Code's own `~/.claude/settings.json`**:
  `"includeCoAuthoredBy": false` and `"attribution": {"commit": "", "pr": "", "sessionUrl": false}`.
- **Enforced at SessionStart, safely.** The hook is idempotent (it writes **nothing** when the keys are
  already correct), merges rather than replaces (every other key and unmanaged `attribution` sub-key
  survives), writes atomically, **refuses to touch a `settings.json` that doesn't parse as JSON**, and is
  fail-open — it never blocks session start. Because Claude Code reads settings at startup, enforcement
  **applies from the next session**.
- **Knob: `CDT_NO_AI_ATTRIBUTION`** (default `1` = on) — `cdt-config attribution on|off`. `off` only stops
  CDT re-applying the keys; it **does not revert your `settings.json`** (CDT never re-enables attribution
  behind your back). Enforcement is also skipped while core CDT is off (`cdt-config off`).
- **Verify:** `cdt-attribution --check` (read-only — exit `0` = compliant, `1` = would change), also
  surfaced as a **`cdt-doctor`** health check.

## [1.59.1] — 2026-07-12
### Fixed
- **Plugin routing:** a task mentioning `preview` no longer triggers a spurious `superpowers` advisory
  (the complexity classifier substring-matched `review`/`audit`; these are now word-matched via the
  CDT-owned deferral only). Advisory-only — it never blocked anything.
- **Docs:** clarified that `CDT_PLUGIN_SCOPE` unset uses each plugin's own registry scope (not a uniform
  `project`).

## [1.59.0] — 2026-07-12
### Added
- **Plugin bootstrap & routing — CDT now knows the companion plugins as data, and recommends them for
  you.** A verified registry (`config/plugins.json`, **13 plugins**) is the single source of truth for
  detection, health, routing, and conflict rules. Identifiers are real
  (`<name>@claude-plugins-official`); `ui-ux-pro-max` is a local CDT skill (no install). Verified against
  the `claude plugin` CLI on **Claude Code 2.x**.
- **`cdt-plugins` CLI (`/cdt:plugins`).** Inspect and manage the companions from one place:
  - Read verbs — **`list` / `status`**, **`doctor`**, **`explain <id>`**, **`sync`** — are idempotent and
    take `--json` on `list` / `status` / `doctor`. `doctor` exits non-zero only when a **required** plugin
    or a core dependency is broken.
  - Write verbs — **`enable <id>` / `disable <id>` / `install <id>` / `update <id>`** — shell out to the
    real `claude plugin` CLI. There is deliberately **no `uninstall`** and **no auto-authentication**.
- **Advisory routing (`cdt-plugin-route`).** Repo-signal + task-keyword rules recommend a plugin or skill
  with a one-line reason each — transparent GUIDANCE that **never blocks**. CDT stays authoritative:
  `orchestrator → task classification → CDT specialist → plugin/skill (advisory) → validation →
  cdt-verify`. Disabled plugins are never recommended; CDT-owned lanes (e.g. code review, planning/TDD)
  defer to CDT.
- **Superpowers modes** — `off` · `manual` · `selective` (default) · `always` — so Superpowers skills are
  suggested only where they help and **never duplicate CDT's planning / review / TDD**.
- **Config knobs (`cdt-config`).** `plugins-enabled` (default on), `plugin-auto-install` (default **off**),
  `plugin-auto-update` (default **off**), `plugin-auto-route` (default on), `plugin-scope` (`user|project`,
  default `project`), `superpowers-mode` (default `selective`), `plugin-strict` (default **on**). Per-plugin
  `enabled/disabled/manual/auto` overrides persist in `~/.claude/.cdt/plugins-state.json` and survive
  plugin updates.
### Security
- **Third-party plugins never auto-execute.** `plugin-strict` (default **on**) gates auto-install of any
  non-`official` plugin — the exact `claude plugin …` command is printed, not run. No `curl | sh`; every
  install identifier is validated against a strict grammar and arg-escaped; captured CLI output is
  **redacted** for tokens/secrets. LSP binaries (`typescript-language-server`, `intelephense`,
  `sourcekit-lsp`), the `terraform` CLI, Playwright browsers, and `github` / `sentry` auth are **not**
  auto-provisioned — the tools **warn and print the exact remediation** instead. Companion plugins
  (`superpowers`, `code-review`, `frontend-design`, `context7`) still auto-install via manifest
  dependencies; `sequential-thinking` still auto-registers via `.mcp.json`.
- **Full reference:** [`docs/plugins.md`](docs/plugins.md).

## [1.58.0] — 2026-07-12
### Changed
- **Menu-bar realtime usage % is now popup-free — and on by default.** The optional network refresh that
  keeps the badge fresh while you work in the VS Code / JetBrains chat panel (introduced opt-in in v1.57.0)
  now ships **on out of the box**, and it no longer surfaces the macOS *"CDT Usage wants to access … keychain
  password"* dialog on its own:
  - **The Keychain read is non-interactive.** The app reads the OAuth token without ever raising a prompt.
    If macOS won't hand it over without interaction, the bar **quietly falls back to the cached reading** and
    shows a calm *"Realtime paused — grant Keychain access"* line — no nagging, no surprise dialogs.
  - **You grant access on your terms.** A prompt appears **only** when you explicitly click the new
    **"Grant Keychain access for realtime usage…"** menu item; if you never do, the badge keeps working off
    the cached reading.
  - **Still rate-safe and read-only.** ≤6 fetches/hour, **zero** while a terminal keeps the status-line cache
    fresh, honors the server's `429 Retry-After` via a persisted cooldown, and reads the token **read-only —
    it never mints or refreshes a token** (minting would log you out of Claude Code).
  - Turn it off entirely with `cdt-config realtime-usage off`.
- **Commits no longer add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` (or any-AI) trailer.** A repo `commit-msg` hook strips
  the trailer, so it never lands in history; run **`scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh`** once to install the guard
  locally. No past history was rewritten.
### Added
- **Zero-config companion setup — no manual MCP or plugin wiring.** The plugin now ships a `.mcp.json` that
  **auto-registers the `sequential-thinking` MCP server**, and its manifest `dependencies` **auto-install the
  companion plugins** (`superpowers`, `code-review`, `frontend-design`, `context7`) — so a fresh install comes
  wired up, with skills auto-applying via the orchestration routing. (context7's MCP comes from the companion
  plugin, so it isn't double-registered.)

## [1.57.0] — 2026-07-01
### Added
- **Opt-in realtime subscription-% refresh for the menu bar (`cdt-config realtime-usage on`, default OFF).**
  Since v1.56.0 the session/weekly % is written *only* by the CLI status line, which Claude Code runs *only*
  in a terminal — so working in the VS Code / JetBrains chat panel (or idling) leaves the badge stale. This
  setting fills that gap **without changing the default no-network behavior**:
  - **Still reads the free status-line cache as primary.** The network path is a *fallback*, not a replacement:
    the menu bar polls `/api/oauth/usage` **at most once every ~10 minutes, and only when the terminal reading
    is already stale (≥5 min old)** — so ≤6 calls/hour worst case, and **zero** while a terminal keeps the
    cache fresh.
  - **Read-only on credentials.** It reads the OAuth token from the Keychain **read-only and never mints or
    refreshes a token** (minting would log you out of Claude Code). On a `429` it honors the server's
    `Retry-After` cooldown everywhere — no bursts.
  - **Merges the fresh %s back into the shared cache** (`~/.claude/.cdt-usage.json`), so `/cdt:budget` and the
    next `cdt-menubar status` benefit from the same refresh.
  - Env flag `CDT_REALTIME_USAGE` in `~/.claude/claude-dev-team.env`; toggle with `cdt-config realtime-usage
    on|off`.
- **`cdt-menubar --refresh-usage`** — a terminal command that forces one gated refresh now (subject to the
  same cooldown / read-only rules).
### Changed
- **Tradeoff stated plainly (why it's opt-in and off by default):** enabling `realtime-usage` brings back the
  occasional macOS Keychain prompt (*"CDT Usage.app wants to use Claude Code-credentials"*) when Claude Code
  rotates its token (~1–3×/day). With the setting **off** (default) the menu bar is **100% unchanged from
  v1.55/1.56** — a pure local-file reader with **no network and no Keychain access**.
- Documented the realtime option in the README menu-bar section and the `/cdt:budget` + `/cdt:menubar` command
  docs.

## [1.56.0] — 2026-06-27
### Fixed
- **Usage % now refreshes when you work in the VS Code / JetBrains panel — with no network and no
  credentials.** The session/weekly % is written *only* by the CLI status line, and Claude Code runs the
  status line **only in a terminal** — never in the editor's chat panel — so working in the panel left the
  menu bar (and `/cdt:budget`) showing a stale reading. After confirming there is **no token-free way** to
  read the % from the panel (Claude Code exposes `rate_limits` only to the status line, not to any hook, and
  persists it to no file), the fix keeps the pure-reader / no-network architecture from v1.55.0 and instead
  makes the **terminal refresh path** obvious: the reading is **account-wide**, so running `claude` in your
  editor's **integrated terminal** (or any terminal) refreshes the badge everywhere.
### Changed
- **Actionable stale guidance on every usage surface.** The menu-bar dropdown stale line, the
  `cdt-menubar status` readout, and `cdt-budget` now say *"refresh: run claude in a terminal (VS Code:
  integrated terminal)"* instead of a vague "restart a session", and the "unavailable" path no longer implies
  the menu bar itself can produce data.
- **`/cdt:doctor` now checks the status line.** It reports `[warn] status line off — usage % won't refresh`
  with the enable + integrated-terminal hint, since an off status line is the silent root cause of a never-
  updating %.
- Documented the terminal-refresh model in the README menu-bar section and the `/cdt:budget` + `/cdt:menubar`
  command docs.

## [1.55.0] — 2026-06-26
### Changed
- **Menu bar drops its own subscription-% fetch and reads usage straight from the CLI status line —
  killing the `/api/oauth/usage` 429s at the root.** The menu bar used to call the undocumented
  `/api/oauth/usage` endpoint itself (reading the Keychain token), and that token-shared burst across
  clients was the sole cause of the recurring `rate limited` state. It is now a **pure reader** of the
  shared cache (`~/.claude/.cdt-usage.json`) that the CLI status line already fills from Claude Code's
  native `rate_limits` payload — **no network call and no Keychain read anywhere in the app**
  (`menubar/Sources/cdt-menubar/`):
  - **Deleted** `SubscriptionAPI.swift` and `Keychain.swift` entirely, plus the whole backoff / heartbeat /
    in-flight / rate-limit / token-rotation machinery in `UsageStore.swift` (≈280 → ≈115 lines). A cheap
    30s timer re-reads the local cache; `refreshNow()` (and wake-from-sleep) just re-reads — nothing to
    throttle.
  - **Dropped from the dropdown:** the plan label (`Max 5x`), weekly-Sonnet %, reset countdowns, and the
    429 retry note — all of which only existed because of the endpoint/Keychain path. The badge still shows
    **session % over weekly %**; the dropdown shows **Usage → Session / Weekly**.
  - **Staleness, not errors:** a reading older than 30 min is grayed with an "as of" time; when the cache
    has never been written (the CDT status line isn't enabled), the dropdown prompts `cdt-config statusline
    on` instead of showing an "unavailable" error.
  - **`cdt-menubar status`** is now cache-only (no `--live`/`--fresh`, no live fetch); unknown flags are
    ignored for compatibility.
- Tests: removed the OAuth-decoder / `UsageError` / Retry-After / Keychain-classification / plan-label
  suites; added cache-parse, staleness-boundary, and snapshot-state coverage (30 tests green).

## [1.54.0] — 2026-06-25
### Changed
- **Menu bar polls the usage endpoint gently (10 min, jittered) and the `status` CLI is cache-first —
  to stop the 429 `rate limited` state.** The undocumented `/api/oauth/usage` endpoint throttles *bursts*,
  and the bursts came from *event-driven* live calls across multiple clients (the app's launch fetch, the
  status line, every `cdt-menubar status`), not the steady heartbeat. Three coordinated changes
  (`menubar/Sources/cdt-menubar/`):
  - **Cadence 5 min → 10 min, with 0–60s jitter** (`UsageStore.swift`). The session/weekly % move slowly,
    so this loses no real freshness while halving steady-state load; jitter stops multiple machines syncing
    into a burst.
  - **Launch guard** — on launch the app no longer fires an immediate live fetch when the on-disk cache is
    already fresh; it defers the first fetch until that reading would go stale. Relaunching repeatedly can
    no longer burst the endpoint.
  - **Cache-first `status`** (`CLI.swift`) — `cdt-menubar status` now reuses the menu bar's fresh on-disk
    reading (labeled `(cached, as of …)`) instead of hitting the endpoint, and only fetches live when the
    cache is missing/stale. A live fetch is persisted to the shared cache so `cdt-budget` / the next
    `status` get it for free. New `cdt-menubar status --live` (`--fresh`) forces a live fetch (the only way
    to see the plan label, Sonnet %, and reset countdowns, which the cache doesn't carry).
  - Read/write of `~/.claude/.cdt-usage.json` is centralized in a new `UsageCache.swift` (single schema +
    merge-write that preserves sibling fields other writers own); pure freshness math is unit-tested
    (`UsageCacheTests.swift`). The existing 429 back-off (honors `Retry-After`, hard cooldown) is unchanged,
    and the monitor remains strictly read-only on credentials (no OAuth minting).

## [1.53.0] — 2026-06-25
### Added
- **Obsidian read-back recall (Obsidian → CDT).** The bridge is now bidirectional: at task start the
  orchestrator's `cdt-recall` ranks your Obsidian vault — your *curated* notes plus the synced CDT
  content — with a dependency-free **BM25** ranker (`hooks/obsidian_recall.py`) and surfaces the most
  relevant notes alongside the vault's own lessons, so Obsidian knowledge actively informs CDT's work.
  New `cdt-obsidian recall "<query>" [N]` subcommand (self-gating — silent when Obsidian is off/unconfigured;
  fail-open). `hooks/recall.sh` appends its output automatically. Search root defaults to the whole vault
  (the parent of the `CDT/` subfolder, so personal notes are included); override with the new
  `cdt-config obsidian-recall-root <path>`. Pure stdlib, no embeddings, no network. Covered by
  `scripts/test-obsidian-recall.sh` (ranking + subcommand gating), wired into `validate.sh`.

## [1.52.1] — 2026-06-25
### Fixed
- **`cdt-doctor` now reports the Obsidian sync's *effective* state.** With the v1.52.0 auto-use behavior
  (setting a vault path auto-enables the bridge), the doctor still read the raw `CDT_OBSIDIAN` toggle and
  mislabeled a path-enabled vault as `off`. It now computes the effective state and shows
  `ON (auto) → <vault>` — matching `cdt-obsidian status` and `cdt-config show`. Display-only; no behavior change.

## [1.52.0] — 2026-06-25
### Added
- **Obsidian bridge** — the CDT vault (`~/.claude/vault/`) can now be exported to an Obsidian vault as
  linked markdown with YAML frontmatter, `[[wikilinks]]`, and an index/MOC. A new `obsidian.sh` hook
  implements the `cdt-obsidian` CLI (`sync` / `status` / `set` / `hook` subcommands). **Auto-use:** point
  it at a vault with `cdt-config obsidian-vault <path>` (default `~/Documents/Obsidian/CDT/`) and the
  session-end sync **enables itself** — no separate toggle; disable any time with `cdt-config obsidian off`.
  The sync fires automatically at session end (Stop hook, synchronous, once-per-session guard, fail-open)
  and can be triggered manually with `/cdt:obsidian`. Shipped default stays off until a path is set.
- **Menu bar — Accounts section (cswap-powered):** a new **Accounts** section in the menu bar dropdown
  lists all your Claude accounts when [`cswap`](https://github.com/realiti4/claude-swap) 0.14+ is
  installed. Shows per-account 5-hour and 7-day usage, a **Switch** radio item per account (confirms
  before switching), and a **Switch: Best** option. Switching delegates entirely to `cswap`; the menu
  bar **never writes to your Keychain**. Install with `uv tool install claude-swap`. Without `cswap`
  0.14+ the section shows an install hint and hides gracefully (degrades on 0.13.x which lacks `--json`).
### Changed
- **Premium-design bar is now mandatory for builders.** `frontend-engineer` is required to apply
  `ui-ux-pro-max` + `web-design-guidelines` + `frontend-design` on **every** web-UI task — generic or
  default AI aesthetics are a non-negotiable rejection bar, not a soft suggestion. `mobile-engineer`
  is required to apply `ui-ux-pro-max` on **every** screen, with Apple Human Interface Guidelines
  (iOS) and Material Design (Android) as hard acceptance bars. Both agents' `## Quality` sections were
  updated from soft "auto-apply" language to an explicit mandate. YAML frontmatter, REPORT sections,
  and anti-hallucination language are untouched; CI lint remains green.

## [1.51.1] — 2026-06-22
### Fixed
- **CI green:** updated the `scripts/e2e.sh` status-line assertion to match the new plain-text line — it
  checked for the old `wk` segment, but the status line now renders `… <N>% weekly`. No runtime change.

## [1.51.0] — 2026-06-22
### Changed
- **Engineering builders + technical-writer run on Opus — reverting the v1.50.0 Sonnet pin.** The seven
  builders (`backend`, `frontend`, `mobile`, `data`, `devops`, `qa`, `diagrams`) and `technical-writer`
  are now pinned **`model: opus`** for production-grade output. Combined with the judgment/review panel and
  the Bug Council ×5 (already Opus), **every substantive agent is now Opus** — only `fast-ops` runs Haiku.
  `lint-agents.sh` enforces this Opus floor (the Sonnet tier set was removed) so it can't silently regress.
- **Worktrees + dynamic workflows are on by default.** The autonomy leash now defaults to **`auto`** and
  both engines ship **on** (`CDT_TEAMS=on`, `CDT_SCALE=on`) — the orchestrator runs parallel git-worktree
  sessions and orchestrates subagents at scale with dynamic workflows freely, whenever the work benefits.
  The only governor left is a **weekly-budget safety valve** that ASKs (never silently DENYs) as you near
  the rate-limit ceiling, so a big run can't lock you out on Max. Effort stays **xhigh — never `max`**.
  Reframed across the `orchestration` skill, the README, and the `auto`/`adversarial` commands; `cdt-config
  reset` now restores `autonomy=auto` + engines on.
- **Status line is minimal, plain text.** It now shows exactly **`CDT on · <model> · <N>% session · <N>%
  weekly`** — added the current-session (5-hour) %, and removed the effort, context-size, session-age,
  running-agents, and phase-board segments. The session+weekly cache that `cdt-budget` / Eco mode read is
  preserved.
- **Removed all custom emoji from CLI/terminal output.** The status line, the per-agent dispatch/finish
  lines (`CDT dispatch: <role>` / `CDT done: <role> · <N> tok`), and the running-agents segment are now
  plain text; the shared role→emoji map (`cdt_emoji.py`) was reduced to the role-name helper.

## [1.50.0] — 2026-06-19
### Changed
- **Model routing is now role-based, deterministic, and lint-enforced — cheaper by default without
  dropping review quality.** The implementation throughput agents (`backend-`, `frontend-`, `mobile-`,
  `data-`, `devops-engineer`, `qa-engineer`, `diagrams`, `technical-writer`) are now **pinned
  `model: sonnet`** instead of inheriting the session model (which defaulted to Opus), so routine
  build/test/docs work runs on Sonnet by **default** — the savings no longer depend on remembering to run a
  Sonnet session. The gated **Bug Council ×5** (`root-cause-analyst`, `code-archaeologist`,
  `pattern-matcher`, `systems-thinker`, `adversarial-tester`) is now **pinned `model: opus`** so hard
  diagnosis stays on Opus regardless of session. The review/judgment panel (`product-manager`, `architect`,
  `ui-ux-engineer`, `code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`) is unchanged (still Opus), and `fast-ops` stays
  the only Haiku agent.
- **`lint-agents.sh` now enforces all three tiers** (CI fails if a tier silently regresses): the Opus set +
  Bug Council must be `opus`, the eight throughput agents must be `sonnet`, and only `fast-ops` may be
  `haiku`.
- **Escalation policy documented** (README + `orchestration` skill): a Sonnet dispatch hands off to Opus
  (per-dispatch `model: opus`) on architecture / security-sensitive / production-deploy / destructive
  infra-DB / complex-root-cause / release-blocker / repeated-test-failure / unclear-requirement triggers,
  and `FULL:` lifts the builders to Opus for the whole task. `data-engineer` / `devops-engineer` are
  Sonnet-by-default but hybrid (destructive/irreversible change → Opus + the mandatory security-veto).

## [1.49.0] — 2026-06-19
### Added
- **The menu bar app now checks for updates and tells you when a new version is out.** It quietly polls the
  GitHub releases API on launch and every 6 h, and when a newer version exists it shows a prominent
  **⬆ Update available — get vX.Y.Z** banner at the top of the dropdown (click → opens the release page) plus
  a best-effort macOS notification (once per version). A new **Updates** submenu (Settings → Updates) shows
  the status (`✓ Up to date (v1.49.0)` or the available version), a **Check Now** action, an **Auto-check on
  launch** toggle (default on, persisted), and the last-checked time. **Notify-only** — it never
  auto-installs (that stays the plugin's `cdt-menubar` path); fail-soft (a failed check never disrupts the
  app or the usage display). Version compare is numeric-aware (`1.10.0 > 1.9.0`). New unit tests + a live
  GitHub E2E check (29 tests).

## [1.48.0] — 2026-06-19
### Fixed
- **The menu bar no longer flashes "credentials not readable from Keychain" on a transient blip.** Right
  after Claude Code rewrites its Keychain credential (token refresh / re-login), the item is momentarily
  unreadable to the menu bar — which used to surface a scary error. Now those transient Keychain failures
  (`interaction-not-allowed` / `auth-failed` / `not-available`) are retried **fast and quietly**, and the
  badge falls back to the status line's cache (`~/.claude/.cdt-usage.json`, kept live without the Keychain)
  showing `cached · refreshing…` with your current %s instead of an error. A note only appears if it
  persists (~2 min). Genuinely-logged-out (`item-not-found`) shows a clear "Claude Code not logged in",
  and network/decode blips are softened too. New Keychain-error-classification test (25 tests total).

## [1.47.0] — 2026-06-19
### Fixed
- **Status-line health metrics are now per-session — multiple terminals no longer clobber each other.**
  `🪟` context size, `⏱` session age, and `🤖` subagent count were stored in a single shared
  `~/.claude/.cdt-usage.json` field, so two terminals in **different projects** overwrote each other (the
  context got clobbered by whichever rendered last, the age showed whichever session started last, and the
  subagent count was the *sum* of both). These are now keyed **per workspace** (`hooks/usage_cache.py`):
  each terminal shows its own numbers. Account-wide subscription usage (`📊 N% wk`) stays a single shared
  value — correct, it's your rate limit. Stale per-session entries are pruned after 24 h. The SessionStart
  (reset), SubagentStop (increment), and status-line (read/refresh) hooks all key the same way. New
  multi-terminal isolation test in `validate.sh`.

## [1.46.1] — 2026-06-19
### Docs
- **Documented the status line.** New "Status line (cross-platform)" section in the README with a
  per-segment legend for `CDT on · 🧠 opus · ⚡ xhigh · 📊 3% wk · 🪟 Nk · ⏱ Nh · 🤖 N` (plus the live
  `🔭 Explore×3` running-agents and `🧭 i/N` phase segments), and refreshed the outdated inline example.
  `docs/architecture.md` gains the `PreToolUse (Task)` dispatch hook + the status-line/running-agents wiring
  in its Hooks section. No code change.

## [1.46.0] — 2026-06-19
### Added
- **Live multi-agent status line — see what's running *now*, below "auto mode on".** The CDT status line
  gains a live "running agents" segment (role emoji + count, e.g. `🔭 Explore×3 · ⚙️ backend-engineer×1`)
  that updates as subagents start and finish, plus emoji on every segment and an emoji phase indicator:
  `CDT on · 🧠 opus · ⚡ xhigh · 📊 3% wk · 🪟 148k · ⏱ 7h · 🔭 Explore×3 · 🧭 1/3 Recon`. When no wave is in
  flight it falls back to the cumulative subagents-this-session count (`🤖 N`). Backed by a tiny
  per-workspace running-set (`hooks/running_agents.py`) maintained by the dispatch (PreToolUse[Task]) and
  finish (SubagentStop) hooks — display-only, **zero token cost**, fail-open, and self-healing (stale
  entries pruned after 30 min). The transcript dispatch/finish lines (`▶️/✅`) now use the same shared emoji
  map (`hooks/cdt_emoji.py`), so the auto-mode agents (Explore 🔭, Plan 📐, general-purpose 🤖, …) get real
  icons instead of the generic robot. Enable with `cdt-config statusline on`.

## [1.45.0] — 2026-06-19
### Fixed
- **The menu bar app could silently downgrade itself — the real reason the "unavailable / the data couldn't
  be read because it is missing" bug kept coming back.** `cdt-menubar auto_update` (run from SessionStart)
  rebuilt the app whenever the installed version `!=` the cached plugin version — so a freshly-installed
  **newer** app (e.g. a notarized v1.44.0 release) sitting ahead of the still-cached older plugin (v1.42.0)
  was rebuilt **down** to the older, buggy code. Now it only rebuilds when the app is **missing or strictly
  older** than the plugin (numeric-aware `version_ge`), and never downgrades a newer install.
### Added
- **Never a blank "unavailable" again — cold-start cache seed.** On launch the menu bar now seeds the
  displayed % from the on-disk cache (`~/.claude/.cdt-usage.json`), shown grayed as `cached · refreshing…`,
  so the last-known reading is visible immediately instead of "unavailable" while the first live fetch is in
  flight (and it stays visible if that first fetch is rate-limited).
- **Clear rate-limit feedback.** When the usage endpoint returns 429 the dropdown now shows a live
  `rate limited · retry in Xm` countdown (honoring the server's `Retry-After`) instead of a vague stale
  state — so "it stopped refreshing" reads as "intentionally waiting out the limit," not "broken." The
  no-`Retry-After` fallback back-off is now a gentler 5 min (the value the server actually sends) instead of
  15 min. 6 new tests (24 total, all green).

## [1.44.0] — 2026-06-19
### Fixed
- **Menu bar no longer worsens the usage endpoint's rate limit.** `GET /api/oauth/usage` 429s on bursts.
  Previously `refreshNow()` (the "Refresh now" click), the wake-from-sleep refresh, and token-rotation
  recovery all reset the next-fetch time to "now" — so clicking Refresh while rate-limited immediately
  re-hit the endpoint and could spiral. Now an **active 429 cooldown is honored everywhere** (heartbeat,
  manual refresh, wake, token-rotation), and a healthy reading newer than 20s is reused instead of
  re-fetched — so refresh-mashing and wake flurries can't trip a 429.
- **429 back-off now honors the server's `Retry-After`** (delta-seconds or HTTP-date), clamped to
  [60s, 30min], instead of a blind fixed 15 min — the badge recovers exactly when the server allows,
  not later. Falls back to the fixed back-off when no header is sent.
### Chore
- **Global git ignore for CDT runtime artifacts** — documented that `~/.config/git/ignore` (git's default
  global excludes, no `core.excludesfile` needed) should carry `**/.claude/runtime/`, the per-prompt
  artifacts (`TASK_BRIEF.md`/`ROUTING.json`/`NEXT_PROMPT.md`/`TASK_RESULT.json`), `**/.claude/worktrees/`,
  `**/.claude/.cdt/`, and `**/.claude/.cdt-usage.json` so they never show up as untracked in *any* repo
  (`.claude/specs/` stays trackable). 3 new 429/Retry-After tests (19 total, all green).

## [1.43.0] — 2026-06-19
### Fixed
- **Menu bar usage is now production-grade — the "unavailable" / "the data couldn't be read because it is
  missing" / never-refreshing bug is fixed at the root.** The live `/api/oauth/usage` response returns
  `"seven_day_sonnet":{"utilization":0.0,"resets_at":null}` — a JSON `null` for `resets_at`. The decoder
  modeled that field as a non-optional `String`, so one null threw `DecodingError` and aborted the **whole**
  decode, discarding the perfectly-valid session/weekly numbers and leaving the badge stuck on "unavailable"
  forever (which also looked like a broken auto-refresh). Every nested OAuth field is now fault-tolerant
  (`try?` + optional in a custom `init(from:)`), so no single null/missing/new field can break the read.
  Verified against a captured real payload (now a regression test) and live (`session=4% weekly=0%`).
### Added
- **Cleaner failures + faster recovery.** Parse failures now surface a clean, retryable message
  (`usage format changed — retrying`) instead of the raw Cocoa string, and the app refuses to fabricate a
  misleading `0%` from a body it couldn't actually parse (throws a clean error instead). Expired/denied
  tokens (401/403) now retry on a fast fixed cadence (~45s) instead of an exponential back-off to 5 min, and
  the moment Claude Code rotates the Keychain token (detected via a non-reversible fingerprint — the token
  is never logged) the app refetches immediately, so an expired token clears within seconds. A
  wake-from-sleep observer refreshes instantly instead of waiting out the poll interval. First paint now
  shows `loading usage…` rather than a premature "unavailable".
- **8 new decoder regression/edge tests** (null resets_at, null utilization, empty body, error envelope,
  all-null, garbage, rounding, live smoke) — 16 tests total, all green.
### Chore
- The menu bar now **merge-writes** `~/.claude/.cdt-usage.json` (preserving the status-line's session-health
  fields) instead of overwriting the file, matching v1.42.0's shared-cache discipline.

## [1.42.0] — 2026-06-18
### Added
- **Session health metrics in the status line** — three always-on compact indicators now appear after the
  weekly usage %: `Nk` (current context window size in thousands of input tokens), `Nh`/`Nm` (session age
  since last start/clear/compact), and `N⪟` (subagents fired this session). Example:
  `CDT on · claude-opus-4-8 · xhigh · 62% wk · 148k · 7h · 23⪟`. Driven by a shared
  `~/.claude/.cdt-usage.json` cache with merge-write discipline so all three hooks (SessionStart,
  SubagentStop, statusline) update disjoint fields without clobbering each other. Context is read from the
  current project's JSONL transcript tail (mtime-guarded — only re-reads when the file changes). Session
  start resets on every `/clear` and `/compact`. Zero token cost — hook display-only.

## [1.41.1] — 2026-06-17
### Chore
- `.gitignore` now covers CDT's ephemeral runtime/per-prompt artifacts (`.claude/runtime/`,
  `.claude/TASK_BRIEF.md`, `.claude/ROUTING.json`, `.claude/NEXT_PROMPT.md`, `.claude/TASK_RESULT.json`) so
  they no longer show up in `git status`. `.claude/specs/` stays trackable. No code or behavior change.

## [1.41.0] — 2026-06-17
### Added
- **Phase board + status-line phase indicator** for multi-wave (T2/T3) tasks. The orchestrator marks each
  wave with `cdt-phase "<name>" --agents …`; CDT renders a per-wave board (status ✓/▸/· · agents · token
  total) at each transition and shows a compact `phase i/N <name>` in the status line. Per-phase token totals
  fill in automatically as agents finish (race-safe append-logs; reuses the SubagentStop token sum).
  Display-only → near-zero cost. Toggle: `cdt-config phase-board on|off` (default `on`).

## [1.40.0] — 2026-06-17
### Added
- **Agent-activity display in the CLI** — pretty per-agent lines show who is working and what it cost:
  `▶️ backend-engineer · implementing api/*` on dispatch and `✅ backend-engineer · 48.3k tok` on finish.
  **Display-only** (a hook `systemMessage` — shown to you, never added to the model context) → **zero token
  cost**; the token count reuses the value the SubagentStop hook already sums for `/cdt:stats`. Built on the
  existing `contract-capture.sh` (PreToolUse[Task]) + `agent-track.sh` (SubagentStop) hooks — no new hooks.
  Toggle: `cdt-config agent-activity on|compact|off` (default `on`; `compact` = finish lines only).

## [1.39.0] — 2026-06-17
### Removed
- **Notifications removed entirely.** The Discord/Telegram notifier (`cdt-notify`), its setup CLI
  (`cdt-setup` / `/cdt:notify-setup`), and all `CDT_NOTIFY_*` / Discord / Telegram / webhook configuration
  are gone. The orchestrator now reports milestones (DELIVERED / DEFERRED / BLOCKER / SHIP) **directly to
  you** in its reply. The vault still records sessions + lessons and `/cdt:stats` analytics are unaffected.
  `curl` is no longer a dependency.

## [1.38.2] — 2026-06-17
### Docs
- Made the README media **version-less** (feature card + demo GIF no longer bake in a version number), so
  they never go stale as the version bumps. The authoritative version lives in the badge, CHANGELOG, and
  releases. No code or behavior change.

## [1.38.1] — 2026-06-17
### Docs
- README now leads with a hero **demo GIF** (auto `cdt-spec` extracting cited requirements from a spec
  document) and a branded **feature card** under `docs/media/`. No code or behavior change.

## [1.38.0] — 2026-06-17
### Added
- **Auto `cdt-spec` on referenced documents** (opt-in: `CDT_SPEC_AUTO=true`, default off). When a prompt
  names a real spec **document** — `.pdf`/`.docx`, or a requirement-named `.md`/`.txt` — the UserPromptSubmit
  hook auto-extracts cited requirements into `.claude/specs/` and points the agent at them. It **classifies
  every path first**: source files (`.ts`/`.py`/`.json`/…), **project folders** (`isFile()` check),
  non-existent paths, and URLs are excluded, so it never misfires on code or directories. Sensitive docs stay
  local. (`cdt-verify` stays manual by design — verification must be a deliberate, observed command.)

## [1.37.0] — 2026-06-17
### Added
- **Menu-bar app auto-updates with the plugin.** `cdt-menubar` gains an `auto-update` subcommand that
  rebuilds + relaunches the app **only when its bundle version lags the plugin** (a fast no-op otherwise), and
  `session-start` runs it in the background. So `claude plugin update cdt@claude-dev-team` (which requires a
  restart) now refreshes the menu-bar app automatically on the next session — no manual `/cdt:menubar` needed.
- **`Package.swift` declares the test target only when `Tests/` is present** (via `#filePath`), so staged /
  auto-update builds that copy `Sources/` but not `Tests/` no longer fail.
- **Prompt enhancer runs Haiku at `medium` effort** (configurable `medium|high` via `cdt-config prompt-effort`
  / `CDT_PROMPT_EFFORT`). Core CDT effort is unchanged (xhigh) — the enhancer is a lightweight rewrite that
  never needs xhigh/max. The toolkit + prompt-enhance are ON by default.
### Fixed
- **Menu-bar build keeps code in sync with the stamped version.** `cdt-menubar build` now re-syncs its source
  from the newest cached plugin before compiling, so the app can no longer report a new version while missing
  that version's menu items (e.g. the Toolkit-engine / Prompt-enhance toggles).
- **Toolkit redaction now masks natural-language secrets** (e.g. `password is Hunter2zzzz`, `passphrase of …`),
  not just `key=value` forms. Found by live testing: a sensitivity-gated prompt was correctly kept off the
  external model, but a spoken-form password still persisted into `ROUTING.json` / `TASK_RESULT.json` / the
  injected context. `redact.ts` gains a label-preserving `secret-value` rule that masks only secret-shaped
  values (digit/symbol or ≥10 chars), so ordinary prose like "a password is required" is untouched. +1 test (45 total).

## [1.36.0] — 2026-06-17
### Added
- **Separate enable/disable for the toolkit vs core CDT.** New `CDT_TOOLKIT_ENABLED` switch gates the TS
  engine layer (prompt enhancement, spec, TASK_RESULT finalize) **independently** of `CDT_ENABLED`:
  - CLI: `cdt enable` / `cdt disable` and `cdt-config toolkit on|off` control the toolkit; core CDT stays
    `cdt-config on|off`.
  - `cdt-config` gains toolkit feature toggles: `prompt-mode auto|always|off`, `prompt-enhance on|off`,
    `spec-auto on|off`, `external-ai on|off`, `ocr on|off`, `redact on|off`; all shown in `cdt-config show`.
  - Menu bar: separate **"Enabled (core CDT)"** and **"Toolkit engine"** toggles plus a **"Prompt enhance"**
    submenu (auto/always/off). Writes the env file only; the Keychain stays read-only.
  - The toolkit now reads the global `~/.claude/claude-dev-team.env` as a config layer (precedence: packaged
    defaults < global env < project `cdt.config.json` < process env), so toggles apply to the CLI too.
  - `prompt-enhance.sh` and the Stop-hook finalize honor `CDT_TOOLKIT_ENABLED` (skip when the toolkit is off).

## [1.35.0] — 2026-06-17
### Added
- **claude-dev-team-toolkit** (`toolkit/`) — a deterministic-first TypeScript engine layer that auto-applies
  via plugin hooks/skills (not slash-command-only):
  - **`cdt-prompt` + UserPromptSubmit hook** — prompt intake, advisory routing (RISK → Sonnet +
    security-reviewer; Opus only for architecture/severe-security/prod-release/major-refactor), and
    *conditional* Haiku enhancement via `claude -p` (existing login, no API key). Deterministic-first: the
    model is called only for genuinely unclear/risky/spec-driven prompts, never for sensitive or trivial ones.
    Output is additive `additionalContext` — the original prompt is never rewritten. Hook always exits 0.
  - **`cdt-spec`** — deterministic requirement/spec extraction (PDF/DOCX/MD/image) into `.claude/specs/`; every
    requirement carries a required `source` citation; sensitive docs stay local (do-not-commit banner, no
    external AI); weak/disabled-OCR diagrams → `NEEDS_REVIEW`.
  - **`cdt-verify -- <cmd>`** — the only trusted verification source (`.claude/runtime/verify-events.jsonl`).
    The Stop hook derives `TASK_RESULT.json` verification strictly from evidence (`passed` only on a real
    exitCode 0; never fabricated). TASK_RESULT.json is local-only — **no notifications**.
  - Hardened: realpath write-jail, mandatory redaction (HMAC prompt-hash, no raw prompt stored), fail-closed
    sensitivity gate, safe-degrade validators, docs-only verify exemption, staging guard, session
    circuit-breaker.
### Changed
- `hooks.json` (+UserPromptSubmit), `completion-guard.sh` (docs-only exemption + TASK_RESULT finalize),
  `verify-track.sh` (best-effort verify events), `session-start-vault.sh` (link toolkit bins + recursion
  guard + dist healthcheck). `notify.sh` is untouched and not wired to TASK_RESULT.

## [1.34.4] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- **Menu bar: subscription % no longer freezes for hours after a transient rate-limit.** Root cause
  (live evidence): the subscription poll was a *self-re-arming one-shot* timer — it scheduled the next
  poll only inside a fetch's completion. After one transient `429` (the endpoint rate-limits **bursts**;
  normal 5-min polling is fine), a later fetch never completed its re-arm (a network `await` could hang up
  to the ephemeral session's **7-day** default resource timeout), so the subscription chain **died** while
  the independent local-token timer kept running — the % stayed stuck ~8h ("rate limited · last good 9:41
  PM") even though the endpoint was returning 200.
  - **Resilient scheduling:** subscription polling now runs off a single **repeating heartbeat** timer
    (`.common` mode) with an in-flight guard that force-clears a stuck fetch — a hung/failed fetch can
    **never** break the poll chain; it always resumes on the next backoff window.
  - **Hard fetch timeout:** the usage session sets `timeoutIntervalForResource = 25` so a stalled request
    can't hang for days. (Also removed a `waitsForConnectivity=false` line that caused consistent timeouts.)
  - Backoff preserved (5 min healthy · 15 min on 429 · escalating otherwise), now driven by a `nextFetch`
    time instead of a fragile re-arm.

## [1.34.3] — 2026-06-16
### Fixed
- **Menu bar: usage now actually auto-refreshes in the background (App Nap was the real root cause).**
  The "stuck %" report's true cause: the menu-bar app is an `LSUIElement` background app, and macOS **App
  Nap** was suspending its refresh `Timer`s — so the %s froze (observed live: stuck at **93% for ~55 min**
  while a fresh fetch and the server both returned **7%** after the 5-hour window reset). Two targeted
  fixes: **`LSAppNapIsDisabled`** in `Info.plist` (App Nap off app-wide so background timers aren't
  suspended) and the local + subscription timers now run in **`.common` run-loop mode** (so they fire even
  while the menu is open / during event tracking). The 5-min subscription poll and 1-min local poll now
  run reliably in the background. The v1.34.2 no-cache hardening stays (correct, just not the cause).

## [1.34.2] — 2026-06-16
### Fixed
- **Menu bar: usage fetch can no longer serve a stale cached read.** The `/api/oauth/usage` request used
  the default cache policy on `URLSession.shared` (which has an on-disk `URLCache`), so in principle
  "Refresh now" could return a cached body instead of a live read. It now uses a dedicated **ephemeral,
  no-cache session** (`reloadIgnoringLocalAndRemoteCacheData` + `Cache-Control: no-cache`) so every refresh
  is a real network round-trip.
  - **Honest scope (root cause likely server-side):** the endpoint returns a *fresh envelope* per call
    (`resets_at` recomputes each time) but its utilization value appears to be a server-side aggregate that
    only recomputes when the official usage page (`claude.ai/settings/usage`) is loaded — which the app
    can't control. This fix removes the *client* as a cause; if a value still looks stuck at 100% until you
    open the usage page, that's the server endpoint, not the menu bar.

## [1.34.1] — 2026-06-16
### Docs
- README: new **"Updating CDT (get the latest version)"** section — `claude plugin marketplace update
  claude-dev-team` + `claude plugin update cdt@claude-dev-team` (restart to apply), `/cdt:version` to
  check, and how to refresh the macOS menu-bar app (re-run `/cdt:menubar`, or download the notarized DMG
  from the latest release).
### Packaging
- The **notarized `CDT Usage` DMG** (v1.34.1) is attached to the GitHub release so users can update the
  menu-bar app without rebuilding from source.

## [1.34.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- **Automation-first discipline — agents stop inventing manual deploy/build commands.** New
  `automation-first` skill encodes the command hierarchy: **explicit user command > Makefile >
  package/composer scripts > `scripts/` > docs/CI > manual fallback.** Before any build/deploy/run/release
  command, agents inspect the repo and prefer its automation — **Makefile first**; dev deploy/build →
  **`make up-dev`** when present. **Never** run a manual `serverless`/`gradle`/`npm`·`ng build`/`cap
  sync`/AWS·CDK·SAM deploy before checking the Makefile; if a Makefile target **fails, STOP and report** —
  no improvising another path without approval.
  - Wired into the orchestration skill (SKILL.md STEP 3 rule + auto-apply routing table) and **every
    command-running agent** (`backend`/`frontend`/`mobile`/`devops`/`qa`/`data`-engineer — including
    `data`, which runs migrations directly and is a risk-floor category).
  - **Reviewers + QA now flag manual-command usage** when an equivalent Makefile target or repo script
    exists (`code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer` deploy-hygiene, `qa-engineer`).
  - Also added to the global operating summary (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`). New `e2e.sh` doc-regression checks.

## [1.33.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- **Adaptive advise + ship integration** — Phase 5 (final) of *Parallel Orchestration v2* (all four goals,
  compounding; additive). `cdt-advise "<task>"` now also recommends the **agent mix** — the typical squad
  size (from the tier prior) + the specialists your codebase actually uses (from `agent_runs` telemetry) —
  and points at `cdt-route` for per-agent model sizing. SKILL.md STEP 4 gets a **fast-ship** note: once the
  gate chain is green, flow straight into `/cdt:ship` (or `/cdt:autopilot`) rather than re-litigating done
  work — the verify/scope/memory gates + security veto are the safety net.
- **Parallel Orchestration v2 track complete** (v1.29.0–v1.33.0): fast parallel dispatch · shared-context
  packs · production-grade model right-sizing · quality-via-parallelism · adaptive advise — all additive to
  the baseline, all within bounded dispatch, all above the production-grade model floor. Spec:
  `docs/specs/2026-06-16-parallel-orchestration-v2.md`.

## [1.32.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- **Quality-via-parallelism (bounded)** — Phase 4 of *Parallel Orchestration v2* (the quality axis;
  additive). For high-stakes work, CDT now spends a few *extra* parallel agents — ordinary bounded `Agent`
  calls on production models, **never** the Workflow engine — gated by tier + risk + budget:
  - **Adversarial verify** (`/cdt:adversarial`, new command) — 2-3 independent Opus reviewers each try to
    **refute** a risky change/finding; rework if a majority do. Catches plausible-but-wrong work a single
    rubber-stamp pass misses.
  - **Diverse-lens Wave-2 review** — each reviewer takes a distinct lens (correctness · security · perf ·
    a11y/UX) so redundancy can't hide a failure mode.
  - **Design judge-panel** (Wave 0, ambiguous design only) — 2-3 architect variants → judge → synthesize.
  - SKILL.md STEP 3f documents the patterns + their gates; they deepen the Wave-2 review + security veto,
    never replace them. New `e2e.sh` doc-regression checks.

## [1.31.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- **Production-grade model right-sizing** — Phase 3 of *Parallel Orchestration v2* (cost + production-grade;
  additive). New `cdt-route "<subtask>"` advises **Opus vs Sonnet** by difficulty signals (risk /
  ambiguity / architecture / review → Opus; substantive build/test/throughput → Sonnet) and **never
  recommends Haiku for substantive work** — only explicitly trivial mechanical ops route to `fast-ops`.
  Cost-effectiveness comes from spending Opus only where it pays, never from a model that can't do the job.
- **Production-grade model floor is now lint-enforced** — `scripts/lint-agents.sh` fails CI if any
  non-`fast-ops` agent is pinned to Haiku (the Sonnet+ floor for substantive agents). SKILL.md model-
  routing section points at `cdt-route`. New `e2e.sh` route assertions + a lint negative test.

## [1.30.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- **Shared-context packs (dedup)** — Phase 2 of *Parallel Orchestration v2* (cost + fast shipping;
  additive). Parallel agents used to each re-read the same files — wasted tokens and ramp time. New
  `cdt-context pack <files…>` distills the shared context **once** into a manifest (file list + key
  signatures, language-agnostic) at `~/.claude/.cdt/context/<session>.md`; the orchestrator injects it
  into each Wave-1 agent's READ list (SKILL.md STEP 3) and keeps it as the **stable prompt-cache prefix**
  across the wave. `cdt-context show|path|reset`; stale packs GC'd at SessionStart; pure-shell, fail-open.
  New `e2e.sh` assertions (extracts signatures, omits noise).

## [1.29.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- **Fast parallel dispatch** — Phase 1 of the *Parallel Orchestration v2* track (faster shipping +
  cost-effective tokens, **purely additive** — the full baseline flow/agents/skills/gates are untouched).
  - **Budget-elastic fan-out:** `cdt-auto fanout <tier>` recommends how many parallel agents to dispatch
    given remaining weekly headroom — **full tier width when there's room, trimmed toward the floor near
    the ceiling, never below the security-review + qa-verify floor.** More concurrency when affordable
    (faster), trim only *optional* agents when tight.
  - **Worktrees-by-default for parallel multi-writer waves** (≥2 concurrent writers; any T2+ build wave,
    all of T3) so writes truly can't collide and strands run in parallel — `CDT_WORKTREE_DEFAULT=0` to
    force in-place; single-writer waves and T0/T1 stay in-place.
  - **Low-risk fast path:** T0/T1 low-risk changes skip optional Wave-0/Wave-2 agents and ship fast — the
    completion mandate, verify gate, and security review still run.
  - SKILL.md STEP 3 updated; new `e2e.sh` assertions for the fan-out sizing.

## [1.28.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- **Cost truthfulness — orchestrator-overhead metering + slice-first as a code gate.** Phase 5 (final) of
  the enforcement track. A new `hooks/usage-lib.sh` centralizes transcript token-summing (reused by the
  per-agent telemetry); at `Stop`, `completion-guard.sh` records the **orchestration overhead** — the
  orchestrator's own tokens vs the work it delegated — to the events DB, and `/cdt:stats` shows it.
- **Slice-first BREADTH is now enforced, not just advised.** `cdt-auto slice record <n>` stamps a token
  baseline; `cdt-auto project <total>` extrapolates per-item cost from a measured slice vs
  `CDT_SCALE_TOKEN_CAP` (`ALLOW`/`STOP`); and `cdt-auto gate scale` now returns **ASK** in auto mode until
  a recent slice baseline exists — so a workflow can't fan out before its cost has been measured.
### Changed
- **README "Why" now documents the enforced-vs-trusted boundary** with a code-backed enforcement table,
  and a design spec lands at `docs/specs/2026-06-16-enforcement-gates.md`. The gates *detect/surface/block*;
  the orchestrator still authors the work — stated plainly rather than over-claimed.
- `hooks/agent-track.sh` refactored to use `usage-lib.sh` (identical token accounting; e2e-verified).

## [1.27.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- **Memory gate + smarter recall (fixes "forgets yesterday's lesson").** Phase 4 of the enforcement
  track. Persisting a vault lesson was a prompt-only checklist step; nothing nudged you when it was
  skipped. Now a **team-tier** session (it dispatched ≥1 specialist — solo T0/T1 work is exempt) that
  ended with edits but recorded **no fresh lesson** gets a Stop-time nudge: `cdt-config memory
  warn|block|off` (**default `warn`**). Detected from the state DB (`agent_runs` for the session) + the
  `learnings.md` mtime vs the edit marker; once per session; fail-open.
### Changed
- **`cdt-recall` now re-ranks by recency + outcome, not just lexical overlap.** Among the lessons that
  match a query, newer ones win (exponential decay, ~180-day half-life) and lessons whose terms appear in
  **painful past tasks** (high iterations / blocked, from the `tasks` table) surface first — so hard-won
  lessons rank higher. Still pure-stdlib, grep fallback, fail-open. Weights tunable via
  `CDT_RECALL_RECENCY_WEIGHT` / `CDT_RECALL_OUTCOME_WEIGHT` / `CDT_RECALL_HALFLIFE_DAYS`.

## [1.26.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- **Scope/sprawl detection — "exclusive file ownership" is now code-checked (fixes "sprawls a simple
  change into ten files").** Phase 3 of the enforcement track. The contract's exclusive-file scope used to
  be prose only; nothing detected when an agent wrote outside it.
  - A **`PreToolUse(Task)` hook** (`hooks/contract-capture.sh`) records each dispatched agent's contract
    from a `CDT-CONTRACT: exclusive=api/**,server/** ; read=types/**` line the orchestrator now emits
    (SKILL.md STEP 2). Contracts live under `~/.claude/.cdt/contracts/<session>/{pending,claimed}/`.
  - **`SubagentStop`** (`hooks/agent-track.sh`) **atomically claims** the agent's contract (lock-free
    `mv pending→claimed`, safe under concurrent waves) and diffs the files the agent **actually wrote**
    (from its own transcript — attribution works even when parallel agents share one working tree) against
    it. Files outside its scope → **overreach**; files in a peer's scope → **collision**. Recorded to
    `findings.jsonl` + the events DB (`scope_overreach` / `scope_collision`).
  - **Stop gate** surfaces findings: `cdt-config scope warn|block|off` (**default `warn`** — more moving
    parts than the verify gate, so it starts non-blocking). New `cdt-contract` CLI (`add|list|show|
    findings|reset`); stale per-session contracts are GC'd at SessionStart. Glob matching is lenient
    (favours not-flagging). 10 new `e2e.sh` assertions incl. a concurrency double-claim test; fail-open.

## [1.25.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- **Grounding is now code-backed — builders carry context7 (fixes "hallucinates APIs").** Phase 2 of the
  enforcement track. The six engineering builders (`backend` / `frontend` / `mobile` / `data` / `devops` /
  `qa`-engineer) were told "context7 first" but didn't actually carry the tools, so they could only guess.
  They now natively carry `mcp__plugin_context7_context7__resolve-library-id` + `…__query-docs` (the two
  doc tools only — least privilege; no web/toolsearch/other-mcp). Their contracts are strengthened to a
  hard "look it up, never use an unfamiliar third-party signature you haven't queried."
- **`lint-agents.sh` locks it in:** check #4 now allows *only* those two context7 tokens for builders
  (any other `mcp__` still fails), and a new check **requires** the six builders to carry both — so
  grounding can't silently regress to "guess APIs". Covered by a new `e2e.sh` assertion.

## [1.24.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- **Verification gate — the "gates *force* verification" promise is now code-enforced (on by default).**
  Previously the completion mandate was prompt-only and the optional Stop reminder was off by default, so
  nothing structurally stopped a false "done". Now, if a session **edited files but ran no
  test/build/lint/typecheck afterward**, the `Stop` hook blocks it once with an actionable reason. The
  signal is **marker-based and symmetric with edit tracking** (`hooks/verify-track.sh`, a new PostToolUse
  `Bash` hook, mirrors `format-on-write.sh`'s edit marker), so verifications run **inside a subagent**
  (the qa-engineer flow) count too — `hooks/agent-track.sh` marks the session verified when a subagent's
  transcript shows a verifying command. A main-transcript rescue scan keeps false-positives low; the gate
  **fires at most once per session** and is **fail-open** (no python3/markers → never blocks).
  - Configurable: `cdt-config verify block|warn|off` (default `block`); `CDT_VERIFY_REQUIRE_OUTPUT`
    ignores commands that never actually ran (`command not found`).
  - Verb-anchored allowlist (`hooks/verify-lib.sh`): `pytest`/`jest`/`go test`/`cargo test`/`swift test`/
    `npm test`/`tsc`/`eslint`/`ruff`/`make`/… — never `echo`, `git`, `ls`, `prettier`, `npm install`.
  - Outcomes recorded to the state DB (`events.type = verify_gate`). `validate.sh` now also checks every
    `hooks.json` command path exists and is executable. Covered by 13 new `e2e.sh` assertions.

## [1.23.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- **Menu bar now shows your real plan tier** — the `CDT Usage` dropdown header reads
  `Subscription · Max 5x` (or `Pro`, `Free`, …) instead of a bare `Subscription`. 1.22.1 correctly
  noted the `/api/oauth/usage` endpoint carries no plan field, but the tier *is* available locally: the
  Keychain item `Claude Code-credentials` includes `claudeAiOauth.subscriptionType` (`max`/`pro`/…) and
  `rateLimitTier` (e.g. `default_claude_max_5x`, which encodes the 5x/20x multiplier). The app already
  reads that Keychain item for the OAuth token, so this adds **no new network call or permission** — it
  just stops discarding the plan fields. The label is only ever rendered from the real field; an unknown
  tier is title-cased verbatim and a missing one falls back to a neutral `Subscription` (never a guess —
  the rule that drove the 1.22.1 fix still holds). Covered by unit tests on the label mapping
  (`Tests/cdt-menubarTests/PlanLabelTests.swift`).

## [1.22.1] — 2026-06-16
### Fixed
- **Menu bar no longer mislabels the plan as "Claude Max" for Pro users.** The subscription section
  header was hardcoded to "Subscription (Claude Max)", but the `/api/oauth/usage` endpoint returns only
  utilization buckets (`five_hour`, `seven_day`, `seven_day_sonnet`, …) — **no plan/tier field** — so the
  app cannot actually know Pro vs Max. The header is now just "Subscription" (no tier claim); the menu-bar
  doc was reworded to "your real Claude subscription usage". Verified against the live response shape.

## [1.22.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- **`/cdt:version`** (and the `cdt-version` CLI) — print the installed version. It reads the canonical
  version from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (preferring `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, else the newest cached
  install) and, on macOS, also reports the **menu bar app** version baked into `CDT Usage.app`, flagging
  it as stale when the binary lags the plugin. `cdt-version --short` prints just the version string.
- **Menu bar shows the installed version** — the `CDT Usage` dropdown footer now reads `v<x.y.z> · updated
  <time>`. The Swift app resolves its version from the bundle's `CFBundleShortVersionString` (baked from
  `plugin.json` at build) with a plugin-cache fallback for un-bundled `--once` runs; `cdt-menubar status`
  prints it too.
- `cdt-doctor` now checks `cdt-version` is installed alongside the other CLIs.

### Fixed
- **Menu bar no longer shows frozen subscription %s as if they were live.** The bar reads the Claude
  Code OAuth *access* token from the Keychain; when it expires the usage endpoint returns 401 and the app
  kept displaying the last-good reading silently, so session/weekly % appeared stuck until something
  external (Claude Code / claude.ai) refreshed the Keychain token. Now a stale reading is shown as stale —
  the badge numbers gray out, the dropdown header reads "— stale" with a "⚠ token expired — open Claude
  Code or re-login to refresh (last good <time>)" note — and the failed-fetch retry drops from 5 min to
  **60 s** (escalating 60→120→240→back toward 5 min if the token stays bad) so it self-heals quickly once
  the token is refreshed, without hammering the endpoint (429 still backs off 15 min). The bar relies on
  Claude Code's own token refresh — it re-reads the Keychain every poll. In-app token *minting* was
  evaluated and **deliberately declined**: Claude Code's OAuth refresh token is single-use/rotated, so a
  second app minting from it would invalidate the token Claude Code depends on and log the user out.

## [1.21.2] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- **`fast-ops` can now create files from a template** — the agent advertised this but was granted only
  `Edit` (which cannot create new files); added `Write`.
- **State DB no longer drops telemetry under concurrent writes** — `db.sh` sets `busy_timeout` (sqlite3
  CLI) / `connect(timeout=)` (python) so parallel `SubagentStop` waves wait for the lock instead of
  hitting "database is locked" and silently losing the row.
- **`/cdt:notify-setup`** corrected in the env-file template (was a bare `/notify-setup`).

### Hardened (production review)
- **Hooks parse the env file instead of `source`-ing it** (`notify.sh`, `session-start-vault.sh`,
  `completion-guard.sh`) — a value in a hand-edited env can no longer execute. `notify.sh` also validates
  the webhook URL / bot token (rejects quote, backslash, control chars) before it reaches the `curl -K -`
  config line.
- **`statusline.sh`** writes the usage cache atomically (per-PID temp + `os.replace`) so a concurrent
  render can't read a half-written file.
- **`cdt-pr`** reports a clear message when `python3` is absent for `status`/`checks`/`view` (the JSON
  parsers); `diff`/`comment` already degraded cleanly.
- **`code-reviewer`** agent carries an explicit Anti-hallucination section like the builders.
- Independent code review: **APPROVE**; `validate` / `lint-agents` / `e2e` all green.

## [1.21.1] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- **Per-agent token telemetry no longer inflated by cache reads.** `agent-track.sh` previously summed
  `input + output + cache_creation + cache_read` into one `tokens` figure — and for a subagent re-reading
  its cached context every turn, `cache_read` dominated by ~100×, making `/cdt:stats`'s "which roles cost
  the most" ranking meaningless (agents showed ~1.1B "tokens"). Now `tokens` is the **cost-relevant** sum
  (`input + output + cache-creation`) and **`cache_read` is a separate column**, shown apart and labeled
  discounted. The ranking now reflects real cost. New `agent_runs.cache_read` column migrates in place;
  e2e asserts the split (fresh vs cache). *(Historical pre-fix rows keep their old combined `tokens` until
  they age out of the today/week windows — the split is forward-looking; counts/roles are unaffected.)*

## [1.21.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added — Autonomous Agent Orchestration (scaling track Phases 2 + 3, as one controller)
- **Autonomous mode router** (in the orchestration skill, STEP 1.5) — after tiering, CDT reads the *work
  shape* and autonomously picks **BOUNDED** (default), **DEPTH** (agent-team Bug Council that debates), or
  **BREADTH** (dynamic-workflow fan-out). Escalation fires only on signature (stuck bug → team; large
  homogeneous set → workflow), always at **xhigh effort, Opus for judgment, never Haiku, never `max`**.
- **Cost governor — `cdt-auto` (+ `/cdt:auto`)** — `status` / `gate <team|scale>` / `explain "<task>"`.
  The orchestrator **must** consult `cdt-auto gate` before any escalation; it returns **ALLOW / ASK /
  DENY** by enforcing the autonomy leash, each engine's on/off, and a **weekly-budget ceiling**. It
  **fails safe** — unknown or stale budget → ASK, never a silent ALLOW (caught in code review).
- **Config plane — `cdt-config autonomy <off|assist|auto>` / `teams <on|off>` / `scale <on|off>`.**
  Default **assist** (auto-summon teams on stuck bugs; propose+ask before a workflow). Engines ship
  **off**; `teams on` sets `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` (safe nested-`env` merge into
  settings.json); `scale` needs Claude Code ≥ 2.1.154. `cdt-doctor` reports mode + verifies both engines.
- **DEPTH/BREADTH execution protocols** (STEP 3c upgraded, STEP 3e new): teams debate via shared task
  list + mailbox (≤5, time-boxed, then dissolve); workflows are slice-first, contracted, adversarially
  verified, token-capped, with "log what's dropped". Both **fail soft to BOUNDED** if the engine is
  unavailable. The top guardrail now carves the gated Scale-mode exception explicitly.
- Reviewed in Wave 2: **security PASS** (settings.json merge preserves all keys; governor injection-safe),
  **code review** caught + fixed the fail-open governor and a skill contradiction before ship. e2e §9
  covers the full ALLOW/ASK/DENY truth table + the fail-safe + the explain classifier.

## [1.20.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added — Scaling track Phase 1: worktree isolation
- **`cdt-worktree` CLI + `/cdt:worktree` command** — safe git-worktree isolation for parallel work
  (`new` / `list` / `path` / `rm` / `clean`). Each strand gets its own checkout at
  `.claude/worktrees/<name>` on branch `worktree-<name>`, **mirroring Claude Code's `claude --worktree`
  convention** so the two interoperate (same checkout). Turns CDT's disjoint-paths convention into a hard
  filesystem guarantee for big T3 waves / parallel sessions; CDT's HOME-based state means every worktree
  inherits the toolchain for free.
- **Safe by design:** worktree names are validated against path-traversal / option-injection (allowlist),
  removal **refuses a dirty/locked worktree without `--force`** (never a constructed `rm -rf`), and
  `.claude/worktrees/` is auto-added to `.gitignore`. Resolves the **main** worktree via the shared git
  common-dir, so creating a worktree from *inside* a worktree targets the main repo (no nesting).
- **`cdt-doctor`** gains a git/worktree readiness check (+ probes `claude --worktree` support); the
  orchestration skill documents worktree isolation as **opt-in for large parallel work only** (T0–T2 stay
  bounded and in-place). e2e covers create/list/path/reuse/clean + the safety paths (invalid name, dirty
  refusal, force, no-nesting).
- Reviewed in Wave 2: **security PASS** (injection boundary holds), **code review** caught + fixed a
  linked-worktree top-resolution bug before ship.

## [1.19.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Per-agent token telemetry (P2)** — a `SubagentStop` hook now sums each dispatched subagent's **real**
  token usage straight from its transcript JSONL (`input + output + cache_*`) and stores it on the
  `agent_runs` row; tasks gained a `tokens` column too (`cdt-task … <tokens>`). `/cdt:stats` now ranks
  **which roles cost the most tokens** and shows per-tier token totals — all grounded in actual usage
  rows, never an estimate. Backward-compatible: existing DBs are migrated in place (`ALTER TABLE … ADD
  COLUMN tokens`), and the hook is fail-open (no python3 / unreadable transcript → logs the run with 0).
### CI / quality
- **Agent least-privilege lint (P1)** — `scripts/lint-agents.sh` is now a CI gate. It statically asserts
  every agent's contract can't silently regress: explicit `tools:` allowlist (no implicit "all tools"),
  **no agent may carry `Task`/`Agent`** (no fan-out — only the orchestrator dispatches), read-only agents
  have no `Write`/`Edit`, builders stay within `Read/Grep/Glob/Bash/Write/Edit`, Opus/Haiku pins hold,
  and each agent keeps a `REPORT` section + anti-hallucination language. Runs alongside `validate.sh`.

## [1.18.0] — 2026-06-15
### Security / hardening (full agent-system audit)
- **Least-privilege tools** — the 7 builders (`backend/frontend/mobile/data/devops/qa/diagrams`) now
  declare an explicit `tools:` allowlist (`Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write, Edit`) instead of inheriting
  **all tools**. They can no longer spawn subagents (`Task`/`Agent` → cost runaway), `WebFetch`, or
  `NotebookEdit` — only the orchestrator fans out.
- **Anti-hallucination block** added to the 7 agents that lacked it (5 Bug Council + `ui-ux-engineer` +
  `security-reviewer`): ground every claim in real files/output, never fake "done/passing".
- **No same-file collisions** — the contract rule now forbids two agents on the same *file* in one wave
  (e.g. `technical-writer` + `diagrams` on one `.md` run sequentially).
- `ui-ux-engineer` Wave 2 review is now **strictly read-only** (writes only during Wave 0 design).
- `security-reviewer` gains **context7 + WebFetch** to verify CVEs / library security during review.
- `qa-engineer` notes that hard diagnosis warrants Opus / the Bug Council.

## [1.17.1] — 2026-06-15
### Docs
- **README installation overhaul** — a guide-style, production-grade flow: **Step 1 (install, all
  platforms) → Step 2 (per-OS setup) → verify with `/cdt:doctor`**. Separate, collapsible step-by-step
  guides for **macOS / Windows / Linux** (Windows covers Git Bash + the WSL `CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH`
  pin + the status line). Fixed the cross-links. Written via the new technical-writing discipline.

## [1.17.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **`technical-writer` agent + `technical-writing` skill** — a docs specialist for user-facing
  documentation (README, guides, **release notes**, **CHANGELOG**, **ADRs**, **PR descriptions**). Owns
  `docs/*` prose (not diagram blocks); grounds every claim in real code/output; keeps docs↔reality in
  sync. Wired into Wave 1 (parallel, for user-facing changes) + SKILL routing. Roster is now **14 core
  agents**; **8 quality skills**. (Closes the 'writer' gap vs. the reference architecture; media/video
  intentionally skipped as off-mission.)

## [1.16.0] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- **Notifications now report the cost of *that task*, not cumulative budget.** The Discord/Telegram
  message shows **tokens used to deliver this task** (an input+output **delta**) and **how long it took**
  — instead of the running session/weekly %. The orchestrator captures a `cdt-tokens` baseline at task
  start and passes the `--tokens`/`--duration` deltas at delivery.
### Added
- **`cdt-tokens`** — prints today's running input+output token total from local transcripts, so a
  per-task cost can be measured as a delta. Pure python3 stdlib.

## [1.15.0] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- **Plugin renamed to `cdt`** — slash commands are now **`/cdt:*`** (e.g. `/cdt:ship`, `/cdt:doctor`,
  `/cdt:autopilot`) instead of `/claude-dev-team:*`, matching the `cdt-*` CLIs. The marketplace / repo /
  brand stays **claude-dev-team**; install with `claude plugin install cdt@claude-dev-team`. Existing
  installs should reinstall under the new id (`claude plugin uninstall claude-dev-team` → install `cdt`).

## [1.14.0] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- **Notifications are now rich + detailed.** Discord uses a **colored embed** (green delivered / red
  blocker / …) and Telegram a **formatted HTML** message — each with the **task**, **tier**, **duration**,
  **Task-Loop iterations**, and your current **Max usage %** (session/weekly), plus a timestamp.
  `cdt-notify` gained optional flags (`--task --tier --duration --iters --tokens`); bare
  `cdt-notify TYPE "msg"` still works. The orchestrator fills the fields in automatically. Secrets still
  go to curl via a stdin config; all fields are JSON/HTML-escaped (injection-safe).

## [1.13.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Two new role agents (Opus)** — completing a product → design → build → review chain:
  - **`product-manager`** (Wave 0, read-only) — turns a vague/user-facing ask into **requirements +
    testable acceptance criteria + scope/non-goals**; its criteria feed the qa tests and the review's
    scope check. Pairs with `superpowers:brainstorming`.
  - **`ui-ux-engineer`** (Wave 0 design + Wave 2 review) — UX flows, **design system/tokens**, and an
    **accessibility (a11y) + visual-polish review**. Owns `design/*`; auto-applies `ui-ux-pro-max` +
    `web-design-guidelines`; the frontend/mobile engineer implements.
  Roster is now **13 core agents** (+ 5 Bug Council). Wired into the Wave 0/Wave 2 flow, SKILL routing,
  the Opus tier, and the team table/diagram. (Memory stays infrastructure; product ownership stays human.)

## [1.12.1] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Menu-bar **Eco mode** submenu now labels the default option **"Off (default)"** — uniform with the
  Effort ("Xhigh (default)") and Model ("Opus 4.8 (default)") submenus.

## [1.12.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Interactive menu-bar controls.** The macOS menu bar dropdown is now a control panel, not just a
  display: an **Enabled** toggle (enable/disable CDT) plus **Eco mode**, **Effort**, and **Model**
  submenus (current value checkmarked). Each selection runs `cdt-config` and the menu refreshes in place.
  effort/model apply next session, as before.
### Changed
- **Eco mode now defaults to `off`** (was `auto`) — full quality by default; opt in with
  `cdt-config eco on|auto`. Keeps Opus/quality the default and only conserves when you choose to.

## [1.11.4] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Worked e2e example** in `demo/login-rate-limit/`: a stdlib HTTP API (`api/server.py`, `POST /login`)
  + **6 real end-to-end tests** (`tests/test_e2e.py`) that boot the server on a free port and drive the
  full journey with live `urllib` requests (200 login · 401 wrong/unknown · 429 lockout · 429-while-locked).
  Produced by the orchestrator (backend ∥ qa in parallel; security review PASS). The demo suite is now
  **26 tests** and the e2e runs in CI — a concrete demonstration of the e2e quality gate (v1.11.3).

## [1.11.3] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- **e2e is now a first-class quality gate.** The qa-engineer's playbook and the orchestration gate chain
  (now **10 gates**, e2e at #6) require **end-to-end tests for user-facing changes** — the real user
  journey via Playwright/Cypress (web), Detox/Maestro (mobile), or supertest/HTTP-flow (APIs), using
  context7 for the framework API and kept deterministic. If a project has no e2e harness, the orchestrator
  proposes one; if e2e can't run, it says so — **never fakes an e2e pass**. (Distinct from `scripts/e2e.sh`,
  which tests this plugin itself.)

## [1.11.2] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Committed end-to-end test (`scripts/e2e.sh`) + CI gates.** The e2e runs in a **sandbox** (a throwaway
  temp HOME — never touches your real `~/.claude`) and asserts the full chain: SessionStart bootstrap →
  doctor → deps → learn→recall → task→stats → statusline→budget(eco) → config on/off → notify→log. CI now
  runs **three gates** on every push/PR: `validate.sh`, the demo unit tests, and `e2e.sh`. Documented in
  the README ("How to review / audit") and CONTRIBUTING.

## [1.11.1] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- **Documentation:** a single, complete **Requirements** section — a per-OS table of every system tool
  (required vs optional), the "no pip packages — python3 stdlib only" note, and the auto-installed
  companion plugins. Added to the table of contents.
- **Eco mode works on macOS out of the box:** the menu bar app now caches each usage fetch to
  `~/.claude/.cdt-usage.json`, so `cdt-budget`/Eco have fresh data without the status line (Windows/Linux
  still use the status line). Verified end-to-end on macOS.

## [1.11.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Prerequisite installer (`cdt-deps` + `/cdt:deps`)** — checks the system tools CDT uses
  (python3, git, curl, sqlite3, gh) and, with `--install`, installs the missing ones via the detected
  package manager (brew / apt / dnf / pacman / zypper / winget / choco / scoop). Companion **plugins**
  already auto-install via the manifest; scripts use **python3 stdlib only** (no pip packages). First
  session prints a one-line nudge if python3 is missing; `/doctor` points here.
### Changed
- **Cross-platform analytics** — `db.sh` and `cdt-stats` now fall back to **python3's built-in sqlite3**
  when the `sqlite3` CLI is absent (common on Windows), so state logging / stats work everywhere python3
  is present. Independent portability audit across all hooks: **PORTABLE** on macOS / Linux / Windows
  (Git Bash) — every macOS command guarded, `date` has a GNU fallback, all bash-3.2 safe.

## [1.10.1] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Windows support** — the orchestration layer (agents, skills, commands, `cdt-*` CLIs, hooks, vault,
  analytics) now runs on Windows. Added `.gitattributes` to **force LF** on shell scripts (CRLF would
  break the bash shebang on Windows checkouts) and a **Windows & Linux** setup section (Git for Windows +
  Python 3; pin `CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH` if WSL is present; run `/doctor` to verify). The macOS-only
  **menu bar** is skipped on Windows/Linux — use the cross-platform **status line** instead.

## [1.10.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Budget-aware Eco mode** (`cdt-budget` + `cdt-config eco`) — before a T2+ dispatch the orchestrator
  checks your real weekly usage; when high it **conserves** (prefers Sonnet, smallest safe tier, skips
  optional agents) and says why. Never weakens the risk floor / security review, never uses Haiku for
  real work. Default `auto`.
- **Status line** (`cdt-statusline` + `cdt-config statusline on`) — a terminal status line
  (`CDT on · Opus · xhigh · 41% wk`) that works **cross-platform** (Linux/Windows, no menu bar needed) and
  caches your usage % so Eco mode can read it.
- **`/cdt:doctor`** (`cdt-doctor`) — one-command install health check (hooks, CLIs, DB, gh,
  notifier, menu bar, companion deps) with a fix hint for anything not green.
- **`cdt-learn "<lesson>"`** + `/cdt:learn` — teach the vault a durable lesson on demand
  (surfaced later by `cdt-recall`).

## [1.9.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **`cdt-config` + `/cdt:config`** — a control surface to **enable/disable** the whole
  orchestration layer and set its **defaults (effort, model)**. `off` makes the next session behave as
  stock Claude Code (the SessionStart hook stops injecting the protocol). `effort`/`model` are written to
  `~/.claude/settings.json` as a **safe merge** (all other settings preserved) and apply next session.
  Defaults are **xhigh effort + Opus 4.8** (`claude-opus-4-8`); `max` effort is correctly refused
  (session-only). The menu bar dropdown now shows the current mode (`on · xhigh · opus-4-8`).

## [1.8.1] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- **Model-routing guardrail hardened** — made explicit everywhere that **Opus is the recommended main
  model**, and that the **low (Haiku) tier is never used for complicated or quality-sensitive work**.
  Strengthened the `fast-ops` agent and the orchestration skill to escalate on anything complicated or
  quality-sensitive (not just "needs judgment"); updated the README routing note to lead with Opus-as-main.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **PR autopilot (`/cdt:autopilot <PR#>`)** — roadmap **Phase 1**. Drives a real GitHub PR
  toward green: read CI → diagnose → focused fix → push to the branch → re-check (capped by
  `CDT_MAX_ITERATIONS`), resolve merge conflicts on the branch, and post a `code-reviewer` +
  `security-reviewer` synthesis as a PR comment. Backed by `cdt-pr`, a read-mostly `gh` wrapper whose
  only state change is posting a comment.
- **Safe by design:** **dry-run by default** (`--live` to act); **never** force-pushes, auto-merges, or
  closes — merging stays the user's explicit call; security review is mandatory before the "ready"
  verdict; reports each milestone via `cdt-notify`. Requires `gh` authenticated.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Adaptive routing (`cdt-advise`)** — roadmap **Phase 3**. Matches a new task against past `tasks`
  history and returns an **advisory** tier/iteration prior (typical tier, iteration budget, blocker
  rate). The orchestration skill consults it on T2+ but still decides — transparent and overridable,
  never a hidden policy. New `/cdt:advise` command. Pure stdlib (python3's built-in
  `sqlite3`), no new dependencies. Adapted from `ruflo`'s trajectory-learning idea, kept on-ethos.

## [1.6.1] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Haiku tier (`fast-ops` agent)** — a cheap, fast "hands" tier for **trivial, mechanical,
  fully-specified** operations only (gather/grep/count, literal find-replace, rename, typo, whitespace,
  template fill). **Hard-guarded:** it is never routed orchestration, architecture, development, testing,
  review, security, or debugging — and it escalates the instant a task needs judgment, so the cheap tier
  can't touch quality-critical work. Model routing is now an explicit 3-tier strategy
  (Opus = judgment · Sonnet = throughput/testing · Haiku = trivial ops). Adapted from the tiered-routing
  idea in public agent catalogs, kept on-ethos.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Targeted memory recall (`cdt-recall`)** — roadmap **Phase 2, first cut**. Instead of dumping the
  whole learnings file, the orchestrator retrieves only the lessons relevant to the current task via a
  lexically-ranked recall (pure stdlib — **no embedding model or network**). New `/cdt:recall`
  command; the orchestration skill now recalls relevant memory on T2+; the SessionStart hook injects only
  the most recent lessons + a recall pointer. Net effect: **context stays lean and sharp as the vault
  grows** (cost-effective memory that scales).

## [1.5.3] — 2026-06-15
### Docs
- Added **`docs/roadmap.md`** — the phased plan toward a *learning agent network* (autonomous Git/CI/PR
  loop, semantic/RAG memory, adaptive routing, opt-in bounded swarms, federation research), with explicit
  fit/risk/cost notes per phase and the principles that constrain it. Linked from the README.

## [1.5.2] — 2026-06-15
### Docs
- **README polish pass** — added a Table of Contents, a **Troubleshooting** table, a **Security &
  privacy** section, and a dedicated **Uninstall** section; added a PRs-welcome badge.
- **`docs/architecture.md`** — hooks table now includes the `SubagentStop` (`agent-track.sh`) hook and
  the macOS menu-bar auto-install.
- Added **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** and GitHub **issue / PR templates** (`.github/`).

## [1.5.1] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- **`db.sh`** flattens newlines/tabs to spaces in stored values (cleaner rows, no smearing); single-quote
  escaping kept, backslashes left intact (SQLite `'…'` literals don't process them).
- **`pkill -f`** in the menu-bar installer now matches the app path literally (dots escaped), so it can't
  over-match an unrelated process.
- **Keychain error** now surfaces the `OSStatus` (via `SecCopyErrorMessageString`), distinguishing a real
  Keychain failure from "not logged in".
- **`RELEASING.md`** documents that the release version comes from `plugin.json`.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-15
Production-grade hardening pass (full T3 audit: security, devops, content, native, distribution).
### Security
- **Notifier input validation** — `cdt-setup` now strictly validates every pasted secret
  (Discord webhook / Telegram token / chat id) with whole-string anchoring + a control-char/newline
  reject, closing a shell-injection vector (the env file is `source`d, so a crafted value could have
  executed code on session start).
- **Secrets out of `argv`** — Discord/Telegram URLs are passed to `curl` via a stdin config (`-K -`),
  so tokens are no longer visible in the process list (`ps`/`/proc`).
### Fixed
- **Menu-bar auto-install churn** — guarded on a real success marker instead of a legacy plist that the
  SMAppService path never creates, so the app is no longer killed/relaunched on every session/clear/compact.
- **Retain cycle** in the menu bar's subscription poller (`[weak self]` on the refresh task).
- **CI no longer rots to a green no-op** — installs `shellcheck` + pinned Python explicitly, and
  `validate.sh` now fails (not skips) when `shellcheck` is missing under CI.
- **Docs↔reality** — README project layout lists the `menubar` command; prerequisite bumped to
  Claude Code ≥ 2.1.143 (dependency auto-enable); `menubar` command hint includes `restart`.

## [1.4.8] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- Agent-run labels no longer truncate to `claude-dev-team:ba` — the menu bar and `cdt-stats` now strip
  the `claude-dev-team:` namespace prefix and show the bare role (`backend-engineer`, `qa-engineer`, …).

## [1.4.7] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- Menu bar dropdown's **claude-dev-team (7d)** panel now shows **sessions logged** (your chats), so the
  section reflects real activity — not just the rarer specialist-subagent dispatches.
### Changed
- README: menu-bar section + screenshot updated for the stacked **CDT** layout (session % over weekly %).
### Fixed
- No more stray **`unknown`** agent row — the `SubagentStop` hook skips runs with no identifiable agent
  type, **and** the menu bar filters `unknown`/empty rows out at query time, so it never displays even
  if an older in-session hook logged one.

## [1.4.6] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Menu bar keeps the **CDT** label, with the stacked session %/weekly % beside it (CDT left, percentages
  stacked right) — branded but still narrow.

## [1.4.5] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Menu bar shows the two percentages **stacked** (session % over weekly %, color-coded) as a compact
  rendered image — only as wide as "48%" — so it survives a crowded/notched menu bar. Labels stay in the dropdown.

## [1.4.4] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Menu bar strip is now compact (**"CDT 20% 48%"** — session then weekly, color-coded) so it no longer
  crowds out other menu bar items on narrow/notched displays. Session/Weekly labels remain in the dropdown.

## [1.4.3] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- App icon: **CDT Usage.app** now uses the Claude Dev Team logo (`menubar/AppIcon.icns`). README shows the
  logo + a screenshot of the menu bar dropdown. The menu bar itself stays the "CDT <session%> <weekly%>" text.

## [1.4.2] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- The menu bar app installs to **/Applications** (was ~/Applications, which isn't where users look),
  falling back to ~/Applications only when /Applications isn't writable. Override with `CDT_MENUBAR_APPS`.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Plugin auto-install now builds **CDT Usage.app into ~/Applications** (a real, signed app) instead of a
  bare background binary, and registers login via **SMAppService** so macOS Login Items / Background
  Activity shows **"CDT Usage"** (not the signing team name).
- Menu bar: long resets (weekly) show an absolute time (e.g. **"Fri 1:59 AM"**); short ones stay a
  countdown ("in 3h 18m").
### Fixed
- Agent activity no longer logs **"unknown"** runs (tries agent_type/subagent_type/agent_name, else skips).

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Notarized-DMG release pipeline** for the menu bar app (`menubar/release.sh` + `Info.plist` +
  `RELEASING.md`). Builds a signed `CDT Usage.app`, notarizes + staples it, and packages a drag-to-
  Applications DMG that opens on any Mac with no Gatekeeper warnings. `--bundle-only` tests the `.app`
  locally with any cert. Requires a Developer ID Application cert + notarytool credentials (Team ID
  XCANJ7SYKG).

## [1.3.4] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Code signing.** The menu bar build signs the app with an available identity (Developer ID > Apple
  Development; override via `CDT_SIGN_IDENTITY`). A stable signature makes the macOS Keychain "Always
  Allow" persist across rebuilds (no re-prompt). Builds unsigned — still works locally — if no cert.

## [1.3.3] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- **HTTP 429 from the usage endpoint.** Polling was every 60s (too aggressive for the undocumented
  endpoint). Now: subscription %s poll every **5 min** with a **15-min backoff on 429**; local token
  usage still refreshes every 60s. The last good subscription reading stays visible if a refresh fails.

## [1.3.2] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Menu bar strip now shows **`CDT <session%> Session  <weekly%> Weekly`** — percentages prominent +
  color-coded, with the `Session`/`Weekly` labels in a small font.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Menu bar now shows **`CDT <session%> <weekly%>`** (each % color-coded), instead of a single worst-%.
- Dropdown "updated" time uses **12-hour** format.
- The menu bar app **auto-installs on macOS** on the first session after install (build + launch + login
  auto-start); opt out with `CDT_MENUBAR_AUTO=0`. `cdt-menubar uninstall` is now sticky.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **macOS menu bar usage monitor** (native Swift, in `menubar/`). Shows your real Claude Max
  subscription usage (session %, weekly %, Sonnet %, reset countdowns — from the `oauth/usage`
  endpoint) **plus** accurate local token usage by model and dev-team activity. `/cdt:menubar`
  builds it, enables auto-start (LaunchAgent), and launches it; `cdt-menubar status` is a no-GUI readout.
  Fail-soft: if the (undocumented) subscription endpoint is unavailable, local data still shows.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-06-15
### Changed
- Analytics framing: "cost" means **token / rate-limit budget** (Claude subscription session + weekly
  limits), **not money** — `/stats` and the orchestrator wording corrected to match Max.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Accurate analytics.** A `SubagentStop` hook records every agent dispatch by real `agent_type`, so
  `/stats` shows a true agent-run breakdown. A `cdt-task` CLI logs tier + Task Loop iterations at ship
  (the orchestrator calls it in the completion mandate) → tier mix + average iterations in `/stats`.
### Changed
- `/stats` no longer prints a fabricated cost estimate. Billing defers to Claude Code's live `/cost`
  (on Max, marginal token cost is ~$0); `cdt-stats` reports **activity**, accurately, not billing.

## [1.1.2] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- **`cdt-setup --test` now actually sends.** `cdt-notify` was re-sourcing the env file *after* an
  explicit `CDT_NOTIFY_LEVEL=all` override, resetting it to `milestones` (which filters `INFO`), so the
  test was silently dropped. Overrides are now preserved.
### Changed
- `cdt-setup --discord` / `--telegram` are **additive**: configuring a second channel auto-sets
  `provider=both` instead of overwriting the first.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- Docs now use the correct **namespaced** slash commands (`/cdt:notify-setup`, etc.) — the
  bare `/notify-setup` form does not resolve.
### Changed
- README Notifications rewritten: leads with the fastest path (`!cdt-setup` wizard), step-by-step Discord
  and Telegram with the right commands.
- `notify-setup` command supports Telegram **token-only** (chat id auto-detected).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- `cdt-setup` **auto-detects your Telegram chat id** from the bot token (via `getUpdates`) — no manual
  chat-id lookup. Works in both flag mode (`--telegram <token>`) and the interactive wizard.
### Changed
- README: **step-by-step** Discord and Telegram notification setup.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-15
First production release.
### Added
- **Skill routing** — the orchestrator auto-applies the right quality skill per work-type
  (Web/UI → `ui-ux-pro-max` + `web-design-guidelines`, TS → `clean-code-typescript`,
  debugging → `root-cause-analysis`, simplify → `karpathy-guidelines`, etc.) with no manual invocation.
- **Repo CI** (GitHub Actions) + `scripts/validate.sh`: validates JSON manifests, agent/skill/command
  frontmatter, and shell scripts on every push/PR.
- `CHANGELOG.md`.
### Changed
- `frontend-engineer` and `mobile-engineer` now explicitly auto-apply the UI quality skills.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- **Auto-install companions** — `superpowers`, `code-review`, `frontend-design`, `context7` are declared
  as cross-marketplace dependencies and install automatically with claude-dev-team
  (requires Claude Code ≥ 2.1.110 and the `claude-plugins-official` marketplace).

## [0.1.3] — 2026-06-15
### Fixed
- Grant `context7` access to the read-only `architect` and `pattern-matcher` agents.
- Seed a default notify level so `cdt-setup --show` is never blank.
### Changed
- Flatten the Bug Council agents into `agents/` so all 15 agents register.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-15
- Initial release: tech-lead orchestrator, tiered triage, contracts, 10 core + 5 Bug Council agents,
  7 quality skills + orchestration brain, quality gates, Task Loop, completion mandate, SQLite cost
  analytics, Discord/Telegram notifications, and a markdown vault.
