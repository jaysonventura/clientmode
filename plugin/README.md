# claude-dev-team

> An orchestrated software team for Claude Code. One **tech-lead orchestrator** triages every request,
> writes per-agent **contracts**, dispatches **specialist subagents** in parallel, runs a **quality-gate
> chain**, gets **independent review**, then **ships** — and remembers what it learned.

It is built to be **cost-effective on Claude Max while staying high quality**: cheap work stays cheap
(most tasks need no team), and the expensive machinery only engages when complexity or risk demands it.

## What you get

- **Tiered triage (T0–T3)** — trivial edits run solo; features escalate to a parallel team.
- **Autonomous orchestration** — a mode router that escalates to a *debating* **agent-team** (depth) or a
  *fan-out* **dynamic workflow** (breadth) whenever the work benefits — **on by default**, kept capped and
  budget-aware by a weekly safety valve so a big run can't lock you out on Max.
- **Parallel isolation (git worktrees)** — `cdt-worktree` gives each parallel strand its own
  checkout+branch (interops with `claude --worktree`) for collision-free big features.
- **Contract-driven dispatch** — every agent gets exclusive file ownership, a read-list, a verifiable
  done-condition, guardrails, and a ≤150-word structured report. (This is the anti-hallucination engine.)
- **Grounded builders (code-backed)** — the engineering builders (backend / frontend / mobile / data /
  devops / qa) natively carry the **context7** doc tools, so "look it up, don't guess the API" is
  actually possible; `lint-agents.sh` fails CI if a builder ever loses them.
- **Automation-first (no improvised deploys)** — agents prefer existing repo automation over hand-written
  commands: **explicit user command > Makefile > package/composer scripts > `scripts/` > docs/CI >
  manual**. Dev deploy/build → `make up-dev`; on a Makefile-target failure they **stop and report**
  instead of improvising another path. Reviewers + QA **flag** manual `serverless`/`gradle`/`npm`·`ng
  build`/`cap sync`/AWS deploy commands when an equivalent target/script exists. (`automation-first` skill)
- **Deterministic-first toolkit engine (TypeScript)** — **runs on every prompt, zero commands:** sharpens your
  prompt (conditional Haiku via your existing login — **no API key**; sensitive/trivial prompts never leave the
  machine), routes it, **auto-extracts** a spec doc you mention (`cdt-spec`, **cited sources**, source/folders
  excluded), and refuses to fake "done" (**evidence-only** `cdt-verify`). Mandatory **redaction** + a
  `realpath()` **write-jail**; toggle it independently of core CDT.
  See **[Toolkit engine](#toolkit-engine--your-prompts-get-smarter-automatically)**.
- **14 role agents** (product-manager → architect → ui-ux-engineer → builders → technical-writer →
  reviewers, incl. a Haiku `fast-ops` tier) + a gated **5-agent Bug Council** for stuck bugs.
- **10-gate quality chain** (incl. **e2e** for user-facing flows) + a bounded **Task Loop** (iterate to
  green, anti-abandonment, capped).
- **Completion mandate** (tier-scaled) — simplify, review, reuse-audit, dead-code scan, learn, ship.
- **SQLite cost analytics** with **real per-agent token telemetry** (`/cdt:stats` ranks which roles
  cost the most) so you can see and tune spend on Max.
- **No AI attribution on your commits or PRs** — no `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer, no
  `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]` footer, no session link. Enforced in Claude Code's own settings at
  SessionStart (the only source that actually controls it), verifiable with `cdt-attribution --check`.
  See **[Configuration](#configuration)**.
- **A markdown vault** for durable memory (learnings, ADRs, session logs).
- **8 quality skills** (karpathy guidelines, clean TS, code-splitting, gauge-improvements, RCA, web
  design, ui/ux pro-max, technical-writing) plus first-class reuse of the official `superpowers`, `code-review`,
  `frontend-design`, `figma`, and `context7` plugins.

## Why

LLM coding fails in predictable ways: it hallucinates APIs, claims "done" without checking, sprawls a
simple change into ten files, and forgets yesterday's lesson. `claude-dev-team` is a **discipline layer**
that fixes those structurally — contracts force grounding, gates force verification, reviewers catch
mistakes, the vault remembers, and tiering keeps it all affordable.

### Enforcement — code-backed, not just instructed

Those four failure modes are caught by **hooks and CI**, so the discipline holds even when the model
would rather skip it. Each gate is **default-on but configurable**, fires **once per session**, and is
**fail-open** (a missing `python3`/marker never breaks or blocks your session):

| Predictable failure | Code-backed enforcement | Tune |
|---|---|---|
| Claims "done" without checking | **Verify gate** — a `Stop` hook blocks a session that edited files but ran no test/build/lint/typecheck afterward (subagent test runs count). | `cdt-config verify block\|warn\|off` |
| Hallucinates APIs | **Grounding** — builder agents carry the `context7` doc tools; `lint-agents.sh` fails CI if one loses them. | always on (CI-enforced) |
| Sprawls a change into ten files | **Scope gate** — `SubagentStop` diffs what each agent actually wrote against its exclusive-file contract; flags overreach/collisions. | `cdt-config scope warn\|block\|off` |
| Forgets yesterday's lesson | **Memory gate** — a team-tier session that edits but records no vault lesson is nudged; `cdt-recall` ranks by recency + outcome. | `cdt-config memory warn\|block\|off` |
| Blind expensive fan-out | **Cost governor** — escalation is budget-gated; BREADTH is **slice-first** (measure a slice, project the full cost vs the cap before fanning out); per-agent + orchestrator-overhead telemetry. | `cdt-auto`, `cdt-config eco` |

**Honest scope:** the gates *detect, surface, and block* — they don't author the work. The orchestrator
still has to write the contracts, pick the right tier, run the independent review, and emit each agent's
`CDT-CONTRACT:` line; those remain model-driven (the strong-Opus bet), with the hooks as the backstop.

## Architecture

How a request flows (Diagram A):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    U["User request"] --> T["Triage: files + domains + keyword + risk"]
    T --> TIER{"Tier T0-T3"}
    TIER -->|"T0 / T1"| SOLO["Solo / pair"]
    TIER -->|"T2 / T3"| C["Write per-agent contracts"]
    C --> E["Execute: parallel waves"]
    E --> G["Quality gates + Task Loop"]
    G --> R["Independent review + security veto"]
    SOLO --> M["Completion mandate (tier-scaled)"]
    R --> M
    M --> S["Ship"]
    S --> V[("Vault + SQLite")]
```

## Execution model

Parallel waves and the quality-gate chain (Diagram B):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    W0["Wave 0: product-manager + architect + ui-ux-engineer + Explore"] --> W1["Wave 1: builders on exclusive paths"]
    W1 --> GATES["Gates: fmt, lint, type, unit, intg, e2e, build, smoke"]
    GATES -->|"fail"| FIX["Fix agent"]
    FIX --> GATES
    GATES -->|"pass"| W2["Wave 2: code + security + ui-ux review"]
    W2 -->|"security risk >= medium"| VETO["VETO: block ship"]
    W2 -->|"pass"| DONE["Proceed to completion mandate"]
```

## Triage & tiers

`complexity = files + domains + keyword + risk`. Anything touching **auth, payments, infra, migrations,
or secrets** is force-escalated to **T2+** and gets the full mandate (the *risk floor*).

| Tier | Name | Agents | When |
|------|------|--------|------|
| **T0** | solo | 0 | one file, one domain, no risk |
| **T1** | pair | 0–1 | small single-domain change |
| **T2** | squad | 3–5 | multi-domain, or any risk |
| **T3** | full | 6–10 | large / cross-cutting feature |

Tier decision (Diagram C):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Task"] --> RISK{"auth / payments / infra / migrations / secrets?"}
    RISK -->|"yes"| T2["T2+ forced"]
    RISK -->|"no"| SZ{"files and domains"}
    SZ -->|"1 file, 1 domain"| T0["T0 solo"]
    SZ -->|"small, 1 domain"| T1["T1 pair"]
    SZ -->|"multi-domain"| T2b["T2 squad"]
    SZ -->|"large / cross-cutting"| T3["T3 full"]
```

**Overrides you can type:** `T0:` forces solo/cheap · `FULL:` forces full-Opus + all gates for critical
work (raises model + gates only — never effort or engine).

## The team

Orchestrator, specialists, and skills (Diagram D):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    O(("Orchestrator")) --> RES["product-manager / architect / ui-ux-engineer / Explore"]
    O --> BUILD["backend / frontend / mobile / data / devops / qa / writer"]
    O --> REV["code-reviewer / security-reviewer / ui-ux-engineer"]
    O -.->|"stuck bug"| BC["Bug Council x5"]
    O --> SK["skills: karpathy, clean-ts, code-splitting,<br/>gauge, rca, web-design, ui-ux"]
```

| Agent | Model | Role / file scope |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| `product-manager` | Opus | requirements + testable acceptance criteria + scope/non-goals (read-only, Wave 0) |
| `architect` | Opus | design, interfaces, contracts (read-only) |
| `backend-engineer` | **Opus** | APIs, server, data access, logic (`api/server/*`) |
| `frontend-engineer` | **Opus** | web UI/components (`ui/client/*`) — mandatory: `ui-ux-pro-max` + `web-design-guidelines` + `frontend-design` on every web-UI task |
| `mobile-engineer` | **Opus** | RN/Expo/Flutter/native (`mobile/app/*`) — mandatory: `ui-ux-pro-max` on every screen; Apple HIG (iOS) and Material Design (Android) as hard bars |
| `ui-ux-engineer` | Opus | UX flows, design system/tokens, accessibility + visual-polish review (`design/*`) |
| `qa-engineer` | **Opus** | tests + the gate chain (`test/*`) |
| `code-reviewer` | Opus | independent correctness/scope review (read-only) |
| `security-reviewer` | Opus | security review with **veto** (read-only) |
| `devops-engineer` | **Opus** | CI/CD, Docker, infra (`ci/* infra/*`) — destructive/prod infra keeps the security-veto |
| `diagrams` | **Opus** | mermaid / figma visuals |
| `data-engineer` | **Opus** | schema, migrations, queries (`db/*`) — destructive/irreversible migration keeps the security-veto |
| `technical-writer` | **Opus** | user-facing docs — README/guides/release notes/ADRs (`docs/*` prose) |
| **Bug Council** (gated ×5) | **Opus** | root-cause-analyst · code-archaeologist · pattern-matcher · systems-thinker · adversarial-tester |
| `fast-ops` | **Haiku** | the cheap "hands" tier — trivial mechanical ops **only** (gather, literal find/replace, rename, template fill); **never** dev/test/review/security |

**Model routing — role-based, deterministic, and lint-enforced.** Every substantive agent is **pinned
Opus** for production-grade output — the judgment/review panel (`product-manager`, `architect`,
`ui-ux-engineer`, `code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`), the **engineering builders** (`backend`,
`frontend`, `mobile`, `data`, `devops`, `qa`, `diagrams`), **`technical-writer`**, and the gated **Bug
Council ×5** are all Opus, independent of the session model; keep the orchestrator session on **Opus** too.
(The earlier Sonnet throughput pin on the builders was reverted — builders run on Opus for quality.)
`data-engineer` / `devops-engineer` keep the mandatory **security-veto** on destructive/irreversible
changes. **Haiku** (`fast-ops`) is the **low tier for *trivial mechanical* ops only** — it never touches
quality-sensitive work and escalates the instant a task needs judgment. The Opus floor + the one-Haiku
rule are enforced by `lint-agents.sh` (CI fails if either regresses). For ad-hoc subtasks `cdt-route` may
still advise Opus vs Sonnet by difficulty.

## Skills

| Skill | Use it for |
|-------|-----------|
| `orchestration` | the whole workflow (auto-triggers on dev tasks) |
| `karpathy-guidelines` | simplicity-first engineering bar |
| `clean-code-typescript` | strict, readable TS |
| `code-splitting` | file/module/bundle boundaries |
| `gauge-improvements` | prove a change is actually better |
| `root-cause-analysis` | debug to the cause, not the symptom |
| `web-design-guidelines` | UI fundamentals + a11y |
| `ui-ux-pro-max` | polish, motion, micro-interactions |
| `technical-writing` | accurate, scannable, current docs — READMEs, guides, release notes, ADRs |
| `qa-shared` | the QA contract shared by web and mobile — one loop, one artifact layout, one failure-analysis format, one set of safety rules |
| `web-qa` | drive a real browser like a QA engineer — Playwright + MCP, cross-browser, DOM/a11y assertions (never image comparison), console + network checked every scenario |
| `mobile-qa` | drive a real Android device/emulator like a QA engineer — Appium + UiAutomator2 + ADB, evidence on every failure |

Reused official plugins: `superpowers`, `code-review`, `frontend-design`, `context7` — these
**auto-install as dependencies** when you install claude-dev-team (see Installation). `figma` is optional.

## Commands

Plugin commands are **namespaced** — invoke them as `/cdt:<command>` (auto-loaded in a fresh
session; the bare `/command` form won't match).

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `/cdt:triage <task>` | preview the tier + proposed dispatch **without** executing |
| `/cdt:prompt "<task>"` | toolkit: prompt intake + routing + conditional enhancement → `.claude/{TASK_BRIEF,ROUTING,NEXT_PROMPT}` (also auto-runs on every non-trivial prompt) |
| `/cdt:spec <files…>` | toolkit: deterministic requirement/spec extraction → `.claude/specs/*` with cited sources |
| `/cdt:ship` | run the completion mandate on the current work and ship |
| `/cdt:bug-council <symptom>` | convene the 5-agent diagnostic squad |
| `/cdt:autopilot <PR#> [--live]` | drive a GitHub PR toward green — CI fixes, conflicts, review (dry-run by default) |
| `/cdt:stats [today\|week\|all]` | cost & activity report from the state DB — incl. **which agents cost the most tokens** |
| `/cdt:recall <task>` | recall the most relevant past lessons from the vault for a task |
| `/cdt:advise <task>` | advisory tier/effort prior learned from how similar past tasks went |
| `/cdt:config [...]` | enable/disable CDT **+ the toolkit** + set defaults (effort, model, eco, statusline, `prompt-mode`, `redact`, …); defaults xhigh + Opus 4.8 |
| `/cdt:doctor` | health-check the install (hooks, CLIs, DB, gh, menu bar, deps) |
| `/cdt:deps [--install]` | check / install system prerequisites (python3, git, curl, sqlite3, gh) |
| `/cdt:worktree [new\|list\|rm\|...]` | git-worktree isolation for parallel work (interops with `claude --worktree`) |
| `/cdt:web-qa <scenario>` | autonomous web QA in a real browser — navigate, run the journey, assert the accessibility tree, catch JS/network errors, capture trace+video on failure, re-run until green |
| `/cdt:mobile-qa <scenario>` | autonomous mobile QA on a device/emulator — install, run the flow, capture screenshot/video/logcat on failure, explain the cause, re-run until green |
| `/cdt:auto [status\|gate\|explain\|off\|assist\|auto]` | the autonomous mode router + cost governor (BOUNDED / DEPTH / BREADTH) |
| `/cdt:budget` | show usage % + the Eco (conserve-when-low) recommendation |
| `/cdt:learn <lesson>` | teach the vault a durable lesson (surfaced later by recall) |
| `/cdt:menubar [install\|status\|...]` | macOS menu bar usage monitor (session/weekly usage % + local tokens) |
| `/cdt:plugins [list \| doctor \| explain <id> \| sync \| enable/disable/install/update <id>]` | inspect & manage the companion plugins (registry-driven, read-only detection; `--json` on list/status/doctor) — see [Plugin bootstrap & routing](#plugin-bootstrap--routing) |
| `/cdt:obsidian` | sync the CDT vault to your Obsidian vault (on-demand; also fires automatically at session end when enabled) |
| `/cdt:version` | show the installed version (plugin + menu bar app) |

---

## Plugin bootstrap & routing

CDT ships knowing the companion plugins **as data**. A verified registry
(`config/plugins.json`, **15 plugins**) is the single source of truth for **detection, health, routing,
and conflict rules** — so CDT can tell you which plugin fits a task, whether it's healthy, and never
front-run its own agents with one. Verified against the `claude plugin` CLI on **Claude Code 2.x**.

The registry knows the four official companions that auto-install (`superpowers`, `code-review`,
`frontend-design`, `context7`), the language LSPs (`typescript-lsp`, `php-lsp`, `swift-lsp`), MCP/tooling
plugins (`playwright`, `github`, `sentry`), `terraform`, `laravel-boost`, the community plugins
`ponytail` and `claude-mem`, and the local `ui-ux-pro-max` skill. Official install identifiers are real
(`<name>@claude-plugins-official`); `ui-ux-pro-max` is a CDT-local skill with **nothing to install**.

**All in one install.** A single `claude plugin install cdt@claude-dev-team` lands the whole toolchain: the
bundled skills/agents/commands, the `sequential-thinking` MCP, **12 official plugins** as manifest
`dependencies`, and the **2 community plugins** (`ponytail`, `claude-mem`) via a SessionStart bootstrap that
adds their marketplaces and installs them **without prompting**.

The community pair can't be manifest dependencies: Claude Code leaves a dependency from an unconfigured
marketplace unresolved and **disables the dependent plugin**, and it never auto-adds a marketplace — so
declaring them would disable CDT itself. The bootstrap does `marketplace add` then `install`, is idempotent,
async, bounded and fail-open, and is disabled with `cdt-config bootstrap-community off`. Both still **defer**
in the router — `ponytail` to CDT's simplify step, `claude-mem` to the CDT vault.

The same bootstrap also settles two things a fresh machine otherwise gets wrong. It installs **`bun`** —
`claude-mem`'s six hooks all run `bun-runner.js`, which does *not* self-install, so without it every session
opens on `Error: Bun not found` (`brew`, else `npm`, never `curl | sh`; once per machine;
`cdt-config bootstrap-binaries off`). And it sets **`permissions.defaultMode: auto`**, because CDT's dispatch
loop stalls when every hand-off waits on a prompt — written *only* when `settings.json` has no explicit mode,
never overriding your choice, and one-shot, so reverting it sticks (`cdt-config auto-mode off`).

Beyond that CDT provisions no toolchains or credentials: LSP binaries, Playwright browsers, `uv`, and
`github`/`sentry` OAuth stay warn-with-remediation. **`claude-mem` bills its background compression to your
own usage budget** — see [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md#all-in-one-install).

**Inspect & manage — `cdt-plugins` (`/cdt:plugins`):**

```
~/.claude/bin/cdt-plugins list            # health table: registry ⨝ installed ⨝ enabled ⨝ deps ⨝ overlay
~/.claude/bin/cdt-plugins status --json   # same, machine-readable {id: status}
~/.claude/bin/cdt-plugins doctor          # exits non-zero only if a REQUIRED plugin / core dep is broken
~/.claude/bin/cdt-plugins explain github  # type, routing rules, deps, auth, security & fallback for one id
~/.claude/bin/cdt-plugins sync            # print the exact `claude plugin install/enable …` for gaps
~/.claude/bin/cdt-plugins enable <id>     # overlay=enabled  + claude plugin enable
~/.claude/bin/cdt-plugins disable <id>    # overlay=disabled + claude plugin disable
~/.claude/bin/cdt-plugins install <id>    # claude plugin install (third-party gated by strict mode)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-plugins update <id>     # claude plugin update
```

Read verbs (`list`/`status`/`doctor`/`explain`/`sync`) are **idempotent** and never mutate anything;
`--json` is available on `list` / `status` / `doctor`. Write verbs shell out to the real `claude plugin`
CLI. There is deliberately **no `uninstall`** (no destructive removal), and needs-auth plugins only get a
`/mcp` hint — CDT **never auto-authenticates**.

**Advisory routing.** `cdt-plugin-route "<task>"` matches repo signals (e.g. `package.json`, `*.tf`,
`Package.swift`) and task keywords to **recommend** a plugin or skill with a one-line reason each. It is
transparent guidance that **never blocks**, and CDT stays authoritative:

```text
CDT orchestrator → task classification → CDT specialist → plugin/skill (advisory) → validation → cdt-verify
```

Disabled plugins are never recommended, and any plugin that overlaps a CDT-owned lane **defers to CDT**
(e.g. `code-review` yields to CDT's code-reviewer; `superpowers` never touches CDT's planning / review /
TDD). Superpowers has four modes — `off` · `manual` · `selective` (default; only high-complexity/risk
tasks) · `always` — set via `cdt-config superpowers-mode`.

**Config (defaults):**

```
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config plugins-enabled on|off        # advisory subsystem on/off        (default on)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config plugin-auto-install on|off    # auto-run installs                (default OFF — opt-in)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config plugin-auto-update on|off     # auto-run updates                 (default OFF — user-gated)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config plugin-auto-route on|off      # advisory routing hints           (default on)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config plugin-scope user|project     # where CDT enables plugins        (default project)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config superpowers-mode <off|manual|selective|always>   #             (default selective)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config plugin-strict on|off          # gate third-party auto-install    (default on)
```

Per-plugin `enabled/disabled/manual/auto` overrides persist in `~/.claude/.cdt/plugins-state.json` and
**survive plugin updates**.

**Security posture.** `plugin-strict` (default **on**) gates auto-install of any non-`official` plugin —
the exact `claude plugin …` command is printed, never run. No `curl | sh`; install identifiers are
grammar-validated and arg-escaped; captured CLI output is **redacted** for tokens/secrets. Language-server
binaries, the `terraform` CLI, Playwright browsers, and `github` / `sentry` auth are **not**
auto-provisioned — the tools warn and print the exact remediation instead. Full reference, routing table,
and troubleshooting: **[docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md)**.

## Toolkit engine — your prompts get smarter, automatically

A deterministic-first TypeScript engine (under `toolkit/`) that **runs on every prompt — no commands to
remember.** You just type; CDT quietly sharpens the prompt, routes it, pulls in any spec you mention, and
keeps "done" honest. Everything stays **on your machine** (`.claude/`) — nothing is sent anywhere,
**no API key** (it uses your existing Claude login).

### What happens the moment you hit Enter

```text
You type:  "improve the checkout flow and use requirements.pdf"
              │
              ▼   AUTOMATIC — the toolkit (deterministic, with a touch of Haiku)
   • routes it → tier, model, which specialists, security review?   → ROUTING.json
   • sharpens a vague/risky prompt with Haiku (your login, no key)   → a *suggestion*, never a rewrite
   • spots "requirements.pdf", extracts cited requirements           → .claude/specs/
   • redacts every secret before anything is written to disk
              │
              ▼   THE WORK — the Orchestrator (the model @ xhigh, the tech-lead)
   triage → write per-agent contracts → dispatch specialist agents in parallel
          → quality gates → independent + security review → ship
              │
              ▼   HONESTY BACKSTOP — hooks (code-enforced, v1.64.0)
   verify commands are routed through cdt-verify so the REAL exit code is recorded
          → a RED verdict blocks the Stop and loops (iteration N/5) until it goes green
          → the same failure twice escalates to the Bug Council; the cap reports BLOCKER
          → a reply claiming "done / fixed / passing" without evidence is blocked
```

> **The toolkit preps & guards (automatic, advisory). The Orchestrator decides & ships (it does the real
> engineering).** Routing is *advisory* — `advisory: true`, never auto-dispatch. The toolkit can't build your
> feature; the orchestrator can — the toolkit just hands it a cleaner brief and refuses to let it fake "done."

### The pieces (all auto-run — or invoke them yourself)

| Tool | What it does for you |
|------|----------------------|
| **`cdt-prompt`** | Fires on **every non-trivial prompt** (UserPromptSubmit hook): intake → routing → *conditional* Haiku enhancement → `.claude/{TASK_BRIEF, ROUTING, NEXT_PROMPT}`. `/cdt:prompt` is just the manual button. |
| **`cdt-spec`** | Turns a **PDF/DOCX/MD** into a clean requirement list — **one cited source per requirement, never hallucinated.** With `CDT_SPEC_AUTO=true` it **auto-detects** a spec doc named in your prompt (and ignores source files & folders). |
| **`cdt-verify -- <cmd>`** | The **only** way `verification: passed` is earned — runs your real test/build and captures the actual exit code. A transparent wrapper: same output, same exit code, one trusted event. Since v1.64.0 a bare `npm test` is **redirected here automatically**, and the toolkit is **built on install** so this actually runs (before that it was a dangling symlink on every machine). |
| **`cdt enable｜disable`** · **`cdt status`** · **`cdt init`** | Toggle the toolkit (separately from core CDT), check state, scaffold a project. |

### Why it's safe — by construction, not by promise

- 🔒 **Your secrets never leave the machine.** A *fail-closed* sensitivity gate sends sensitive prompts/docs
  to **no** external model; every artifact is **redacted** (the raw prompt isn't even stored — only a
  redacted copy + an HMAC hash).
- ✅ **No fake "done."** `verification` comes only from a real command's exit code.
- 📄 **No hallucinated requirements.** `cdt-spec` copies + cites; it never invents — and its auto-detect
  **classifies every path first**, so `.ts`/`.py` source files, project **folders**, missing paths, and URLs
  are excluded; only a real `.pdf`/`.docx` (or requirement-named `.md`) is treated as a spec.
- 🧱 **Can't write outside `.claude/`** (realpath write-jail); validators **safe-degrade** instead of
  crashing; a docs-only edit never trips the verify gate.

### Controls (CLI or the macOS menu bar)

```sh
cdt enable | cdt disable                   # the whole toolkit, separate from core CDT (cdt-config on|off)
cdt-config prompt-mode auto|always|off     # when Haiku fires (auto = only unclear/risky prompts)
cdt-config prompt-effort medium|high       # the enhancer's effort (Haiku) — your real work stays xhigh
cdt-config spec-auto on|off                # auto-extract a spec doc named in your prompt (default off)
cdt-config redact on|off                   # mask secrets/PII in artifacts (default on — keep it)
```

On macOS the **menu bar** has the same toggles (Enabled / Toolkit engine / Prompt enhance), shows your live
usage %, and **auto-rebuilds itself** when you update the plugin.

_Builds on first session (`cd toolkit && npm install && npm run build`). Config precedence: packaged defaults

## Installation

### Requirements

**Claude Code ≥ 2.1.143** (so dependencies auto-*enable*, not just install; on 2.1.110–2.1.142 the
companions install but you may need to enable them once). The official marketplace must be registered (it
ships by default — else `claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-official`).

**System tools** — run **`~/.claude/bin/cdt-deps`** to check what's present, **`cdt-deps --install`** to
install the missing ones via your package manager:

| Tool | Required? | Used for | macOS | Debian/Ubuntu | Windows |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|---------------|---------|
| **python3** | **required** | recall, advise, config, status line, analytics | `brew install python3` | `apt install python3` | python.org · `winget install Python.Python.3.12` |
| **git** | **required** | install, autopilot, version ops | `brew install git` | `apt install git` | gitforwindows.org · `winget install Git.Git` |
| **bash** | **required** | runs the hooks & `cdt-*` CLIs | preinstalled | preinstalled | **Git for Windows** (Git Bash) |
| **sqlite3** (CLI) | optional | analytics CLI — *python3 fallback exists* | `brew install sqlite` | `apt install sqlite3` | `winget install SQLite.SQLite` |
| **gh** | optional | PR autopilot | `brew install gh` | `apt install gh` | `winget install GitHub.cli` |
| **swift** (Xcode) | optional | the macOS menu bar app only | `xcode-select --install` | — | — |

**No Python packages to install** — every script uses the **python3 standard library only** (`json`,
`sqlite3`, `re`, …). There is no `pip install` step.

**Zero-config companions.** claude-dev-team **auto-installs its companion plugins** (declared as manifest
`dependencies`): `superpowers`, `code-review`, `frontend-design`, `context7` (`figma` is optional). It also
ships a `.mcp.json` that **auto-registers the `sequential-thinking` MCP server** — so a fresh install comes
wired up with no manual MCP or plugin setup. (context7's MCP comes from its companion plugin, so it isn't
double-registered.)

**Platforms:** macOS · Linux · **Windows** — each has a step-by-step guide in
[Step 2 — Set up your platform](#step-2--set-up-your-platform) below. The **menu bar is macOS-only**;
elsewhere use the cross-platform status line.

### Step 1 — Install the plugin (all platforms)

```
claude plugin marketplace add jaysonventura/claude-dev-team
claude plugin install cdt@claude-dev-team
```

> The repo / marketplace is **`claude-dev-team`** (the project); the plugin installs as **`cdt`**, so its
> commands are short — **`/cdt:ship`**, **`/cdt:doctor`**, … (matching the `cdt-*` CLIs).

Install **auto-enables** the plugin and its companions (`superpowers`, `code-review`, `frontend-design`,
`context7`) — no manual enable step. It's a **user-scope** install in `~/.claude/`, shared across every
Claude Code surface on this machine (the CLI, the VS Code & JetBrains extensions, and the desktop app).
*(Non–Claude-Code tools like Google Antigravity run a different engine and won't load it.)*

### Step 2 — Set up your platform

Follow the guide for your OS, then run **`/cdt:doctor`** — it verifies hooks, CLIs, the DB, `gh`, the
menu bar, and companion plugins, and prints a fix for anything not green.

<details open>
<summary><b>🍎 macOS</b></summary>

1. **Install the system tools** (or run `~/.claude/bin/cdt-deps --install` to do it for you):
   ```
   brew install python3 git          # required · gh + sqlite are optional
   ```
2. **Restart your Claude Code session** (or run `/reload-plugins`) so the plugin loads.
3. **Menu bar app** — it builds + installs automatically on your first session (look for the **CDT** item
   showing your session/weekly %). It needs the Swift toolchain — if it doesn't appear, run
   `xcode-select --install`, or grab the **notarized DMG** from the [Releases](https://github.com/jaysonventura/claude-dev-team/releases) page. Manage it with `/cdt:menubar`.
4. **Verify:** `/cdt:doctor` → all green. Done — just describe a task.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🪟 Windows</b></summary>

Claude Code runs the plugin's `.sh` hooks through **Git Bash**, so:

1. **Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)** (provides Bash) and
   **[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** — tick *"Add Python to PATH"* during setup.
2. **If you also have WSL,** pin Git Bash so hooks don't resolve to WSL's `bash.exe`. Add to
   `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json`:
   ```json
   { "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe" } }
   ```
3. **Restart your Claude Code session** (or `/reload-plugins`).
4. **Usage display** — the menu bar is macOS-only; turn on the cross-platform **status line** instead:
   ```
   ~/.claude/bin/cdt-config statusline on
   ```
5. **Verify:** `/cdt:doctor` → all green. *(Shell scripts ship with LF line endings via `.gitattributes`,
   so Git's autocrlf can't break them.)*

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🐧 Linux</b></summary>

Bash + Python 3 are standard, so it works out of the box:

1. Make sure `python3` and `git` are installed (`~/.claude/bin/cdt-deps --install` adds any missing via
   apt / dnf / pacman / zypper).
2. **Restart your Claude Code session.**
3. **Usage display** — the menu bar is macOS-only; use the status line: `cdt-config statusline on`.
4. **Verify:** `/cdt:doctor` → all green.

</details>

### After install → just prompt (zero config)

Describe any task normally. The `orchestration` skill auto-triggers, the SessionStart hook bootstraps the
vault + SQLite DB + `cdt-*` CLIs, skills auto-apply, and the `/cdt:*` commands are available.

- **Always-on (power users):** for a hard guarantee every session, drop the `orchestration` summary into
  your global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)). Most users don't need this.

### Updating CDT (get the latest version)

CDT is tracked from `main`, so updating is two commands + a restart:

```
claude plugin marketplace update claude-dev-team   # refresh the marketplace from the repo
claude plugin update cdt@claude-dev-team           # update the plugin (restart required to apply)
```

Then **restart your Claude Code session** (or `/reload-plugins`). Check your version with
`claude plugin list` or **`/cdt:version`** — it also flags the macOS menu-bar app when it lags the plugin.

**macOS menu-bar app** — the plugin update ships the new app *source*; refresh the running app one of two ways:
- **Re-run `/cdt:menubar`** — rebuilds & relaunches `CDT Usage.app` from the updated source (needs the Swift toolchain), **or**
- **Download the notarized DMG** from the **[latest release](https://github.com/jaysonventura/claude-dev-team/releases/latest)**, drag `CDT Usage` to Applications, and open it (notarized — no Gatekeeper warnings).

Releases follow semver; the **[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)** lists every version. Latest: **v1.62.1**.

## Usage examples

Just describe the task — the orchestrator triages and runs the right amount of process.

- **T0 — "fix this typo in the README"** → stays solo, edits, verifies, ships. One model call.
- **T2 — "add a rate-limited `/login` endpoint with tests"** → risk floor forces T2+: `architect`
  designs the interface, `backend-engineer` implements (`api/*`), `qa-engineer` writes tests (`test/*`),
  gates run, `security-reviewer` checks the auth path, then ship.
- **T3 — "build a settings page (web + mobile) with API + a migration"** → full team in parallel waves:
  architect → backend + frontend + mobile + data (exclusive paths) → gates + Task Loop → code + security
  review → ship + vault learning.

T2 example as a sequence (Diagram E):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant A as architect
    participant B as backend-engineer
    participant Q as qa-engineer
    participant S as security-reviewer
    U->>O: add rate-limited /login with tests
    O->>A: contract - design auth + interfaces
    A-->>O: interfaces + file plan
    O->>B: contract - implement api/*
    O->>Q: contract - tests test/*
    B-->>O: done + evidence
    Q-->>O: gates green
    O->>S: security review (risk floor)
    S-->>O: PASS
    O-->>U: shipped
```

## Autonomy & debugging

**Task Loop** — bounded autonomous quality enforcement (Diagram F):

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Build
    Build --> Gates
    Gates --> Pass: all green
    Gates --> Fix: failure
    Fix --> Gates: re-run
    Gates --> Stuck: same failure twice
    Stuck --> BugCouncil
    BugCouncil --> Gates
    Fix --> Cap: hit CDT_MAX_ITERATIONS
    Cap --> Report: BLOCKER / DEFERRED
    Pass --> [*]
    Report --> [*]
```

**Bug Council** — convened only when stuck (Diagram G):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    BUG["Stuck bug"] --> O(("Orchestrator"))
    O --> RCA["root-cause-analyst"]
    O --> ARCH["code-archaeologist"]
    O --> PM["pattern-matcher"]
    O --> ST["systems-thinker"]
    O --> AT["adversarial-tester"]
    RCA --> SYN["Synthesize: ranked root cause + fix plan"]
    ARCH --> SYN
    PM --> SYN
    ST --> SYN
    AT --> SYN
    SYN --> ENG["Engineer implements fix"]
```

Anti-abandonment: agents must emit a structured `BLOCKER` rather than quit or fake success. The loop
stops after `CDT_MAX_ITERATIONS` (default 5) and reports what's left — protecting your Max rate limits.

> **DEPTH upgrade.** With agent teams enabled (`cdt-config teams on`), the Council convenes as a
> *debating* **agent-team** — a shared task list + mailbox so the five lenses challenge each other before
> a verdict, instead of five parallel monologues. It's gated by the cost governor (`cdt-auto gate team`)
> and falls back to parallel subagents when teams are off. See
> [Autonomous orchestration](#autonomous-orchestration-router--cost-governor).

**PR autopilot (opt-in).** `/cdt:autopilot <PR#>` drives a real GitHub PR toward green: read
CI status → diagnose + dispatch a focused fix → push to the branch → re-check → and, once green, post a
`code-reviewer` + `security-reviewer` synthesis as a PR comment. It's deliberately **safe**: **dry-run by
default** (add `--live` to act), **never force-pushes, never auto-merges, never closes** — merging stays
your explicit call. Bounded by `CDT_MAX_ITERATIONS`, reports each step to you. Needs `gh`
authenticated. Uses a read-mostly wrapper (`cdt-pr`) whose only write is posting a comment.

---

## Parallel isolation (git worktrees) + budget-elastic fan-out

For **parallel multi-writer waves** — several features at once, or each builder in a T2+/T3 wave —
CDT turns its *disjoint-paths* convention into a **hard filesystem guarantee** with git worktrees: each
strand gets its own checkout + branch, so even shared-file edits can't collide and strands run truly in
parallel (faster shipping). This is **on by default** when ≥2 agents write concurrently
(`CDT_WORKTREE_DEFAULT=0` to force in-place; single-writer waves and T0/T1 stay in-place).

Before fanning out, the orchestrator sizes the wave with **`cdt-auto fanout <tier>`** — full tier width
when there's weekly budget headroom, trimmed toward the floor near the ceiling, but **never below the
security-review + qa-verify floor**. More concurrency when it's affordable; trim only the *optional*
agents when it isn't.

**Shared context packs (dedup)** — instead of each parallel agent re-reading the codebase, Wave 0
distills the shared files **once** into a manifest (`cdt-context pack <files…>` → file list + key
signatures) that's injected into each agent's READ list and kept as a prompt-cache-friendly prefix. Fewer
tokens, faster ramp.

**Production-grade model floor** — the judgment roles **and the engineering builders** are pinned **Opus**
for production-grade output (`lint-agents.sh` fails CI if a builder drops below it, or if any non-`fast-ops`
agent is pinned to Haiku). For ad-hoc subtasks `cdt-route "<subtask>"` still advises Opus vs Sonnet by
difficulty; only the trivial `fast-ops` hands tier runs Haiku.

**Quality-via-parallelism (high-stakes work)** — for risk-flagged changes or findings you must trust, CDT
spends a few *extra* parallel agents on Opus (bounded agents, or a dynamic workflow for large verification sets): **adversarial verify**
(`/cdt:adversarial` — 2-3 independent reviewers each try to *refute* it; rework if a majority do),
**diverse-lens Wave-2 review** (each reviewer a distinct lens), and an optional **design judge-panel**
(2-3 architect variants → judge → synthesize). Budget-gated; it deepens the Wave-2 review + security
veto, never replaces them.

```
~/.claude/bin/cdt-worktree new <name>     # isolated checkout at .claude/worktrees/<name> (branch worktree-<name>)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-worktree list           # see all worktrees
~/.claude/bin/cdt-worktree rm <name>      # remove after committing + merging back (refuses dirty without --force)
```

It **interoperates with Claude Code's native flag** — `cdt-worktree new feat` and `claude --worktree feat`
open the *same* checkout — so you can spin up a worktree and drop a parallel session into it. CDT's state
(DB, vault, `cdt-*` CLIs) lives in `~/.claude/`, so **every worktree inherits the full toolchain for
free**. Safe by design: names are validated (no path traversal), removal refuses a dirty/locked worktree
unless you pass `--force`, and `.claude/worktrees/` is auto-added to `.gitignore`.

> **On by default for parallel multi-writer waves.** Worktree setup has a small cost, so single-writer
> waves and T0/T1 stay in-place — but whenever ≥2 agents write at once, each strand gets its own checkout
> automatically. This is **Phase 1 of the scaling track** ([`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md)); the
> autonomous controller below drives the rest.

---

## Autonomous orchestration (router + cost governor)

On top of tiered triage, CDT runs an **autonomous mode router**: after scoring a task it reads the *work
shape* and decides whether to stay **BOUNDED** (contained work) or escalate to **DEPTH** (an agent-team
Bug Council that *debates*) or **BREADTH** (a dynamic workflow that fans out). It escalates **freely
whenever the shape benefits** — a stuck/ambiguous bug → a team; a large or homogeneous set
(audit/migration/exhaustive review) → a workflow — and **always at xhigh effort, Opus for judgment, never
Haiku, never `max`**.

A lightweight **budget safety valve** keeps "use the big engines freely" and "don't lock yourself out on
Max" both true. Before a big escalation the orchestrator does a quick check:

```
~/.claude/bin/cdt-auto status            # mode, engines, caps, live weekly-budget headroom
~/.claude/bin/cdt-auto gate team|scale   # -> ALLOW (proceed) | ASK (confirm near ceiling) | DENY (autonomy off)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-auto explain "<task>"  # advisory: which mode the router would pick, and why
```

With the engines on, the gate normally returns **ALLOW**; it **ASKs** only as you near the **weekly-budget
ceiling** (or before the first un-measured fan-out), and **DENYs** only if you've turned autonomy off. Every
escalation's real token cost lands in `/cdt:stats`.

| Autonomy mode | Agent-teams (DEPTH) | Workflows (BREADTH) |
|---|---|---|
| `off` | — | — (pure bounded, like stock) |
| `assist` | **auto-summons** on stuck bugs (≤5, time-boxed) | **proposes + asks** first |
| **`auto`** (default) | auto-summons within budget | self-runs within the budget ceiling, else asks |

```
cdt-config autonomy off|assist|auto      # the leash (default: auto)
cdt-config teams on|off                  # DEPTH on by default (sets the experimental agent-teams flag)
cdt-config scale on|off                  # BREADTH on by default (needs Claude Code >= 2.1.154)
```

> **On by default, still measured.** The engines ship **on** — depth + breadth are first-class tools, not
> a last resort. They stay *capped, measured, and logged*: a weekly-budget safety valve asks before a run
> that would push you toward the Max ceiling, and the per-agent token telemetry records every escalation's
> real cost. Turn an engine off per machine with `cdt-config teams off` / `cdt-config scale off`.

---

## State & cost analytics

A local SQLite DB (`~/.claude/claude-dev-team.db`) records `sessions`, `tasks`, `agent_runs`, `events`,
and `usage`. Run `/cdt:stats` (or `cdt-stats today|week|all`) for activity by tier/agent, iteration
counts, and blocker rate. Activity/timing is precise. "Cost" here means **token / rate-limit budget**
(Claude subscription session + weekly limits, not money); for exact tokens used, see Claude Code's `/cost`.

**Per-agent token telemetry (real, not estimated).** A `SubagentStop` hook reads each dispatched
subagent's **actual** token usage from its transcript and stores it on the `agent_runs` row — so
`/cdt:stats` ranks **which roles cost the most**. The headline figure is **cost-relevant tokens**
(`input + output + cache-creation`); **cache reads are tracked and shown separately** because they're
heavily discounted and — for a subagent re-reading its cached context every turn — would otherwise be
~100× larger and swamp the ranking. Grounded in real usage rows, never a guess. Example:

```
Agent runs — which roles cost the most (role · runs · tokens; +cache reads, discounted):
  security-reviewer  ×6  142.0k  (+8.1M cache)
  backend-engineer   ×3   98.5k  (+5.2M cache)
  qa-engineer        ×2   23.0k  (+1.4M cache)
Total agent tokens: 263.5k  (+ 14.7M cache reads, discounted)
```

Use it to tune routing — e.g. if a role dominates the *cost-relevant* spend, reserve `FULL:` / Opus
builders for the work that truly needs them.

**Adaptive routing (learns from history):** on T2+, the orchestrator also runs
`cdt-advise "<task>"` — an *advisory* prior derived from how **similar past tasks** went (typical tier,
iteration budget, blocker rate). It's a hint that sharpens triage over time, never a hard rule — the
orchestrator still decides. Pure local DB read, no new dependencies.

## Memory & recall

The orchestrator keeps **durable memory** in a markdown vault (`~/.claude/vault/`): `learnings.md`
(lessons), `sessions/` (per-task notes), `adrs/`, and `log.md` / `status-log.md`. The completion mandate
appends a lesson after meaningful work, so it gets smarter over time.

To stay **cost-effective as the vault grows**, memory is *retrieved, not dumped*: each session injects
only the few most recent lessons, and for a specific task the orchestrator runs **targeted recall** —

```
~/.claude/bin/cdt-recall "<task or topic>"        # or: /cdt:recall <task>
```

— which ranks the lessons by relevance and returns just the top matches (pure stdlib — **no embedding
model or network**). Among relevant lessons it re-ranks by **recency** (newer wins) and **outcome**
(lessons whose terms appear in painful past tasks — high iterations / blocked — surface first), so
hard-won lessons rank higher. Context stays lean and sharp no matter how large the vault grows.

Persisting a lesson is also **gate-checked**: a team-tier session that edits files but records none is
nudged at Stop (`cdt-config memory warn|block|off`, default `warn`; solo work is exempt).

## Menu bar usage monitor (macOS)

A native Swift app (`menubar/`) puts your usage in the menu bar as a compact **`CDT`** badge with the
**current-session %** stacked over the **weekly %** (each color-coded 80/90) — a deliberately narrow,
two-line shape that survives a crowded or notched menu bar. Click it for the full dropdown:

- **Usage %** — current session (5-hour) and weekly (7-day), color-coded 80/90. The **primary source** is the
  **CLI status line's shared cache** (`~/.claude/.cdt-usage.json`), which the status line fills from Claude
  Code's native `rate_limits` — a **free, local read: no network call, no credentials**. Enable the status
  line (`cdt-config statusline on`) to feed it; a reading that hasn't refreshed recently is grayed with an "as
  of" time. To keep the badge fresh while you work in an editor's chat panel, a **popup-free realtime refresh**
  (on by default) *additionally* polls the usage endpoint — throttled, read-only, and prompt-free; see the
  realtime bullet below.
  - **Keeping it fresh in VS Code / JetBrains (or any IDE):** the status line — the *only* thing that writes
    the % — runs **only in a terminal**, never in the editor's Claude **chat panel**. So when you work in the
    panel the % goes stale. The reading is **account-wide**, so one terminal session refreshes it everywhere:
    run `claude` in your editor's **integrated terminal** (or any terminal) and the badge updates. The stale
    dropdown line and `/cdt:budget` both point you here. (There is no token-free way to read the % from the
    panel itself — Claude Code exposes `rate_limits` only to the status line, not to hooks, and persists it to
    no file — so a terminal session is the no-network refresh path.)
  - **Realtime refresh (on by default, popup-free):** so the badge keeps updating even while you work in the
    panel, the menu bar *additionally* polls `/api/oauth/usage` **at most once every ~10 minutes, and only when
    the terminal reading is already stale (≥5 min old)** — so ≤6 calls/hour worst case, and zero while a
    terminal keeps the cache fresh. It reads the OAuth token from the Keychain **read-only (never mints or
    refreshes a token)**, honors the server's `Retry-After` on a 429 via a persisted cooldown, and merges the
    fresh %s back into the shared cache so `/cdt:budget` benefits too. **No surprise dialogs:** the Keychain
    read is **non-interactive**, so realtime never raises the macOS *"CDT Usage wants to access … keychain
    password"* prompt on its own. If access isn't granted it **quietly falls back to the cached reading**
    (a calm *"Realtime paused — grant Keychain access"* line) — no nagging. A prompt appears **only** when you
    explicitly click **"Grant Keychain access for realtime usage…"** in the dropdown. Turn the whole thing off
    with `cdt-config realtime-usage off`; force one gated refresh from a terminal with
    `cdt-menubar --refresh-usage`.
- **Tokens today (local)** — your real token usage by model (with cache) and the 7-day total, summed
  from your own `~/.claude/projects` transcripts.
- **`claude-dev-team` activity panel** — separate **Enabled (core CDT)** and **Toolkit engine** toggles, a
  **Prompt enhance** (auto / always / off) submenu, plus **Eco mode / Effort / Model** submenus to change
  CDT's defaults right from the bar (they call `cdt-config`; effort/model apply next session), then the
  **7-day activity**: sessions logged, **tasks by tier** (e.g. `T2×4 T3×2`), and the
  **specialist subagents dispatched by role** (e.g. `security-reviewer ×6`). For each role's **token
  cost**, run `/cdt:stats`.
- **Installed version** — the dropdown footer shows the running version (e.g. `v1.22.0`) alongside the
  last refresh; check it any time without leaving the bar (or run `/cdt:version`).
- **Updates (Settings → Updates)** — the app checks GitHub for a newer release on launch and every 6h; when
  one's out it shows a **⬆ Update available — get vX.Y.Z** banner (click → release page) + a notification.
  The **Updates** submenu has **Check Now**, an **Auto-check** toggle, and the last-checked time. Notify-only
  — it never auto-installs (re-run `/cdt:menubar` or grab the DMG to update).
- **Accounts** — when [`cswap`](https://github.com/realiti4/claude-swap) 0.14+ is installed, a new
  **Accounts** section lists all your Claude accounts with their 5-hour and 7-day usage, a **Switch**
  radio item per account (prompts for confirmation before switching), and a **Switch: Best** option that
  picks the account with the most headroom. Switching delegates entirely to `cswap` — the menu bar never
  writes to your Keychain. Install `cswap` with `uv tool install claude-swap`; without it the section
  shows a brief install hint and gracefully hides.

**On macOS it auto-installs** on your first session after the plugin is installed — it builds, launches,
and enables login auto-start automatically (set `CDT_MENUBAR_AUTO=0` in `~/.claude/claude-dev-team.env`
to opt out). Manage it any time:

```
!~/.claude/bin/cdt-menubar status      # one-shot terminal readout, no GUI
/cdt:menubar restart       # or: install | start | stop | uninstall
```

Requires macOS + the Swift toolchain (`xcode-select --install`). The session/weekly %s come primarily from
the CLI status line's cache — a free, local read (so turn the status line on with `cdt-config statusline
on`); the **popup-free realtime refresh** (on by default) additionally polls the usage endpoint read-only
and throttled to keep the badge fresh in an editor panel (disable with `cdt-config realtime-usage off`). Your
local token data is summed
from your transcripts and always works. `cdt-menubar uninstall` removes the login item + binary (and stops
auto-reinstall).

Store app), see [`menubar/RELEASING.md`](menubar/RELEASING.md) — it needs a Developer ID Application
certificate + `notarytool` credentials, then `cd menubar && ./release.sh`.

## Status line (cross-platform)

The **status line** is the bottom-bar usage display — the menu bar's cross-platform equivalent (works on
macOS, Linux, and Windows; no Swift/Keychain needed). Turn it on with `~/.claude/bin/cdt-config statusline on`
(restart Claude Code to see it). It's **display-only and costs zero tokens** — a hook renders it from the
session JSON Claude Code already provides, and it fails soft (any missing piece is just omitted). It's
**plain text — no emoji.**

The full line:

```
CDT on · Opus 4.8 · 12% session · 41% weekly
```

Each ` · `-separated segment:

| Segment | Example | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `CDT <on\|OFF>` | `CDT on` | whether claude-dev-team is enabled (`cdt-config on\|off`) |
| model | `Opus 4.8` | the active session model |
| N% session | `12% session` | **current session** usage — your rolling 5-hour rate-limit utilization |
| N% weekly | `41% weekly` | **weekly** usage — your 7-day rate-limit utilization |

Both percentages are **account-wide** (your subscription's rate limits read the same in every terminal).
They're cached to `~/.claude/.cdt-usage.json` so `cdt-budget` / Eco mode can read them without the Keychain.

The per-agent dispatch/finish lines in the transcript are likewise plain text (`CDT dispatch: Explore`,
`CDT done: Explore · 74.1k tok`); the plugin namespace is stripped (shows `backend-engineer`, not
`cdt:backend-engineer`). Claude Code's **own** running-agents tree still shows the namespaced name — that
prefix is fixed by Claude Code.

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| session model | your choice | Sonnet = cheap throughput; Opus = max power |
| `FULL:` / `T0:` prefixes | — | up/down-throttle a single request |
| `CDT_MAX_ITERATIONS` | 5 | Task Loop hard cap |
| `CDT_AUTONOMY` | auto | autonomous escalation leash: `off` / `assist` / `auto` |
| `CDT_TEAMS` · `CDT_SCALE` | on · on | the DEPTH (agent-team) / BREADTH (workflow) engines — on by default |
| `CDT_AUTONOMY_WEEKLY_CEILING` | 85 | budget safety valve pauses to ASK at/above this weekly usage % |
| `CDT_STOP_REMINDER` | 0 | `1` = remind once to run the mandate at session end |
| `CDT_AGENT_ACTIVITY` | on | `on` / `compact` / `off` — pretty per-agent dispatch/finish lines + token cost in the CLI (display-only, **zero tokens**) |
| `CDT_PHASE_BOARD` | on | `on` / `off` — per-wave **phase board** + a `phase i/N` status-line indicator on T2/T3 tasks (display-only) |
| `CDT_PLUGINS_ENABLED` | 1 | advisory plugin subsystem (detection / health / routing); `cdt-config plugins-enabled on\|off` |
| `CDT_PLUGIN_AUTO_INSTALL` · `CDT_PLUGIN_AUTO_UPDATE` | 0 · 0 | **off by default** — CDT never installs/updates plugins without opt-in |
| `CDT_PLUGIN_AUTO_ROUTE` | 1 | advisory plugin/skill routing hints (never blocks) |
| `CDT_PLUGIN_SCOPE` | project | where CDT prefers to enable plugins — `user` / `project` |
| `CDT_SUPERPOWERS_MODE` | selective | `off` / `manual` / `selective` / `always` — never duplicates CDT's plan/review/TDD |
| `CDT_PLUGIN_STRICT` | 1 | gate auto-install of non-official plugins (see [Plugin bootstrap & routing](#plugin-bootstrap--routing)) |
| `CDT_NO_AI_ATTRIBUTION` | 1 | keep AI attribution off commits/PRs; `cdt-config attribution on\|off` |

Effort runs at your session level (xhigh, never `max`). The heavier engines — **parallel git-worktree
sessions** and **dynamic-workflow fan-out** — are **on by default** and used whenever the work benefits;
a weekly-budget safety valve only ASKs as you near the rate-limit ceiling (see
[Autonomous orchestration](#autonomous-orchestration-router--cost-governor)). Pin any agent's `model:` in
`agents/*.md` to taste.

**Enable/disable + defaults — `cdt-config` (or `/cdt:config`):**

```
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config                 # show current config
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config off | on        # disable / enable the whole orchestration layer
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config effort xhigh    # default effort: low | medium | high | xhigh
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config model  opus     # default model (e.g. claude-opus-4-8 / opus / sonnet)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config autonomy auto   # autonomous escalation: off | assist | auto  (see /cdt:auto)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config teams on|off    # the agent-team DEPTH engine (on by default)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config scale on|off    # the dynamic-workflow BREADTH engine (on by default)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config reset           # restore defaults: enabled, xhigh, Opus 4.8, autonomy=auto, engines on
```

Defaults are **xhigh effort + Opus 4.8** (`claude-opus-4-8`). `off` makes the next session behave as
stock Claude Code (the SessionStart hook stops injecting the orchestration protocol). `effort`/`model`
are written to `~/.claude/settings.json` as a **safe merge** (your other settings are preserved) and
apply next session. The **macOS menu bar dropdown** also lets you change all of this with a click — an
**Enabled** toggle plus **Eco mode**, **Effort**, and **Model** submenus (each runs `cdt-config` for you).
(`max` effort is session-only — `/effort max` — and intentionally can't be persisted; xhigh is the cap.)

**Budget-aware Eco mode + status line** (also via `cdt-config`):

```
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config eco auto         # opt in to conserve when weekly usage is high (default: off)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config statusline on    # terminal status line: CDT on · Opus 4.8 · 12% session · 41% weekly
~/.claude/bin/cdt-doctor                  # health-check the whole install
~/.claude/bin/cdt-budget                  # current usage % + Eco recommendation
~/.claude/bin/cdt-learn "<lesson>"        # teach the vault a durable lesson
```

Eco is **off by default** (full quality). Opt in with `cdt-config eco on` (always conserve) or
`eco auto` (conserve only when your weekly usage is high). When conserving, the orchestrator prefers
Sonnet, the smallest safe tier, and skips optional agents — and tells you why. **Eco never weakens the
risk floor or skips the security review**, and never uses Haiku for real work. Usage data is supplied
automatically by the **macOS menu bar** (it caches each fetch); on **Linux/Windows**, enable the
cross-platform **status line** (`cdt-config statusline on`) to feed it.

**Verification gate (code-enforced — on by default):** the discipline layer's "gates *force*
verification" promise is real, not advisory. If a session **edited files but never ran a
test/build/lint/typecheck afterward**, a `Stop` hook blocks it from ending with a clear reason — so a
false "done" is caught structurally. It's symmetric with how edits are tracked, so tests run **inside a
subagent** (the qa-engineer flow) count too; it fires **at most once per session** (never traps you),
and degrades fail-open when `python3`/markers are unavailable. Tune it:

```
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config verify block      # default — block a Stop with edits but no verify after them
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config verify warn       # surface a notice instead of blocking
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config verify off        # disable
```

The allowlist is verb-anchored (`pytest`, `go test`, `npm test`, `tsc`, `eslint`, `cargo test`, … —
but never `echo`, `git`, `ls`), so it won't false-trigger on non-verifying commands.

**Scope/sprawl detection (code-backed):** the "exclusive file ownership" contract is no longer just
prose. When the orchestrator dispatches a specialist, it emits a `CDT-CONTRACT: exclusive=…` line; a
`PreToolUse` hook records it, and `SubagentStop` **diffs what the agent actually wrote** (from its own
transcript — works even when parallel agents share one tree) against that contract. Anything **outside
its scope (overreach)** or **inside a peer's scope (collision)** is flagged. Inspect with
`cdt-contract findings`; tune with:

```
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config scope warn       # default — surface a notice at Stop
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config scope block       # stop until the sprawl is reconciled
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config scope off
```

**No AI attribution on commits & PRs (on by default):** with CDT installed, your commits carry no
`Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer, your PRs carry no `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]` footer, and neither
carries a `Claude-Session` link. Those trailers are emitted by Claude Code itself, so the only reliable
switch is **its own settings** — a `CLAUDE.md` rule or a repo git hook can't guarantee it on every machine.
So SessionStart ensures these keys in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
"includeCoAuthoredBy": false,
"attribution": { "commit": "", "pr": "", "sessionUrl": false }
```

The write is a **safe merge** (your other keys survive), **idempotent** (nothing is written when the keys
are already correct), atomic, and fail-open — a `settings.json` that doesn't parse as JSON is left
untouched. Claude Code reads settings at startup, so enforcement **applies from the next session**.

```
~/.claude/bin/cdt-attribution --check     # verify: exit 0 = compliant, 1 = would change (never writes)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config attribution on   # default — enforce on every session (applies immediately too)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config attribution off  # stop enforcing (does NOT re-enable attribution — see below)
```

`off` only stops CDT re-applying the keys; it **never reverts your `settings.json`**, so attribution stays
hidden until you flip those keys back yourself. `cdt-doctor` reports the state as a health check, and
`cdt-config` shows it as `no-attrib`.

**Obsidian bridge (CDT vault → Obsidian):** export the CDT vault (`~/.claude/vault/`) to an Obsidian
vault as linked markdown — YAML frontmatter, `[[wikilinks]]`, and an index/MOC. The sync fires
automatically at session end (Stop hook) when enabled, and can also be triggered manually with
`/cdt:obsidian` at any time.

```
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config obsidian-vault <path>        # set the vault path — this AUTO-ENABLES the sync (default: ~/Documents/Obsidian/CDT/)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config obsidian on|off              # force on, or disable even with a path set (shipped default: off until a path is set)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-config obsidian-recall-root <path>  # vault root that read-back recall searches (default: the vault root)
```

The sync is **fail-open and idempotent** — a missing vault path or any error never interrupts your session.
Run `/cdt:obsidian` to sync on demand or check status with `cdt-obsidian status`.

**Read-back recall (Obsidian → CDT):** the bridge is bidirectional. At the start of a task the orchestrator's
`cdt-recall` ranks your Obsidian vault — *your* curated notes plus the synced CDT content — with a
dependency-free **BM25** ranker (`cdt-obsidian recall "<query>"`) and surfaces the most relevant notes
alongside the vault's own lessons. So knowledge you keep in Obsidian actively informs CDT's work, not just
the other way around. Self-gating (silent when Obsidian is off) and fail-open. Search root defaults to the
whole vault; override with `cdt-config obsidian-recall-root <path>`.

## Security & privacy

`claude-dev-team` runs **entirely on your machine** and phones home to nothing.

- **No telemetry, no outbound traffic.** The plugin sends nothing anywhere — no analytics. Everything
  runs and is stored locally.
- **The menu bar app** (macOS, optional) reads its **primary** figures locally — **no network, no
  credentials**: the session/weekly %s come from the CLI status line's local cache
  (`~/.claude/.cdt-usage.json`), which the status line fills from Claude Code's own `rate_limits`, and token
  *counts* are summed from your own local `~/.claude/projects` transcripts. The only network/credential path
  is the **popup-free realtime refresh** (on by default) — a throttled (≤6/hour), **read-only** poll of your
  usage endpoint that reads the OAuth token **non-interactively** and **never mints or refreshes** it; turn it
  off with `cdt-config realtime-usage off` to make the app a pure local reader. Nothing else is transmitted.
- **Transparency — macOS first-session auto-build.** On macOS, the SessionStart hook compiles the
  plugin's *own* bundled Swift source and installs a login item ("CDT Usage") **once**, in the background,
  only if `swift` is already present. Opt out with `CDT_MENUBAR_AUTO=0` in `~/.claude/claude-dev-team.env`
  (or `cdt-menubar uninstall`). It builds only audited in-repo source — nothing is downloaded.
- **Enabling agent teams** (`cdt-config teams on`) writes `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` into
  your `settings.json` `env` (a safe merge that preserves your other keys). It's **off by default**;
  remove it with `cdt-config teams off`.
- **Hooks are fail-open and local** — they read/write only under `~/.claude/` and exit 0 on any error, so
  they can't break or leak your session.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Commands/agents don't show up | Restart the session or run `/reload-plugins`; confirm `claude plugin list` shows `claude-dev-team` enabled. Commands are **namespaced**: `/cdt:<cmd>`. |
| Companion plugins didn't enable | You're on Claude Code &lt; 2.1.143 — update, or enable `superpowers` / `code-review` / `frontend-design` / `context7` once manually. |
| `cdt-*: command not found` | In a **plain terminal** use the full path `~/.claude/bin/cdt-…` (the `!cdt-…` shorthand only works **inside** Claude Code's input box). |
| Menu bar item missing (macOS) | Needs the Swift toolchain (`xcode-select --install`). Check `~/.claude/bin/cdt-menubar status`; `cdt-menubar restart`. It installs to **/Applications → "CDT Usage"**. |
| Menu bar shows "no usage yet" | The CLI status line isn't feeding the cache — enable it with `cdt-config statusline on`. The menu bar reads session/weekly % from that cache; local token counts work regardless. |
| "Orchestration isn't dispatching agents" | By design — only **T2+** (multi-domain or risk) fans out; small tasks stay solo. See [Triage & tiers](#triage--tiers). Force it with a multi-domain/risk task or the `FULL:` prefix. |
| No vault / DB / CLIs after install | The SessionStart hook bootstraps them — **restart your session once** after installing. |
| Hooks/CLIs not running on **Windows** | Install **Git for Windows** + **Python 3**; if WSL is also present, pin `CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH` (see the [Windows setup](#step-2--set-up-your-platform)). Then run `/cdt:doctor`. The menu bar is macOS-only — use `cdt-config statusline on`. |

## How to review / audit

Everything is plain files. Check: agents honoring exclusive scope (the diffs), gates actually run
(pasted output in reports), `~/.claude/vault/` session notes + learnings, `status-log.md`, and the DB
(`/cdt:stats`).

**Run the test flow yourself** (all four run in CI on every push/PR):

```
bash scripts/validate.sh        # manifests + frontmatter + shellcheck
bash scripts/lint-agents.sh     # agent least-privilege lint (no fan-out, read-only stays read-only, model pins)
python3 -m unittest discover -s demo/login-rate-limit/tests -t demo/login-rate-limit   # unit tests
bash scripts/e2e.sh             # sandboxed end-to-end (temp HOME — never touches your ~/.claude)
```

The **e2e** boots the SessionStart hook in a throwaway sandbox and asserts the whole chain works
(CLIs installed → doctor → learn→recall → task→stats → statusline→budget → config on/off).
To remove the plugin entirely, see [Uninstall](#uninstall).

## Uninstall

```bash
# 1) remove the plugin (stops the hooks / agents / skills / commands)
claude plugin uninstall cdt

# 2) remove the macOS menu bar app + its login item (macOS only)
~/.claude/bin/cdt-menubar uninstall

# 3) (optional) wipe local state — vault, SQLite DB, CLIs, config, staged app source
rm -rf ~/.claude/vault ~/.claude/claude-dev-team.db ~/.claude/claude-dev-team.env \
       ~/.claude/bin/cdt-* ~/.claude/claude-dev-team-menubar \
       ~/.claude/.cdt-menubar-installed ~/.claude/.cdt-menubar-disabled
```

If you added the always-on activator, delete the orchestration block from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. The
companion plugins (`superpowers`, etc.) are independent — uninstall them separately if you wish. After
step 1 you're back to stock Claude Code.

## Roadmap & contributing

**Shipped recently:** the `product-manager`, `technical-writer`, and `ui-ux-engineer` agents + a Haiku
`fast-ops` tier · **real per-agent token telemetry** · **git-worktree isolation** · the **Autonomous
Agent Orchestration** controller (agent-team **DEPTH** + dynamic-workflow **BREADTH**, gated by a cost
governor) · an opt-in **Eco mode** · the **PR autopilot**.

**The bigger arc** — the **scaling track is now shipped**: worktree-isolated parallel work, the
**agent-team Bug Council** (a *debating* council, not parallel monologues), and **dynamic-workflow Scale
mode** — all unified under the autonomous **router + cost governor**, gated/capped/measured, never the
default. What remains is mostly the *learning* track: the autonomous Git/CI/PR loop (partly shipped via
`/cdt:autopilot`), **semantic (embedding) recall** on top of today's lexical recall, history-driven
adaptive routing, a measured roster expansion (SRE / accessibility / performance auditor), and — as
research — cross-machine federation. The full phased plan, with per-phase status + fit/risk/cost, lives
in **[`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md)**.

**Contributing:** see **[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)**. To add an agent, drop a markdown file in
`agents/`; to add a skill, a folder + `SKILL.md` in `skills/`. Before a PR, run the full local gate
chain: `bash scripts/validate.sh` · `bash scripts/lint-agents.sh` · `bash scripts/e2e.sh`. PRs welcome.
