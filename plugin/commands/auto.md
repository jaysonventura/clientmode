description: Inspect & control CDT's Autonomous Agent Orchestration — the mode router (BOUNDED / DEPTH agent-team / BREADTH workflow) and its cost governor. status · gate <team|scale> · explain "<task>" · off|assist|auto.
allowed-tools: Bash

Run the autonomous-orchestration controller with the user's arguments (default `status`):

```
~/.claude/bin/cdt-auto $ARGUMENTS
```

- **`status`** — show the autonomy mode (off/assist/auto), the DEPTH (teams) + BREADTH (scale) engines, the caps, and live weekly-budget headroom.
- **`gate <team|scale>`** — the governor decision the orchestrator consults before escalating: `ALLOW` / `ASK` / `DENY`.
- **`explain "<task>"`** — advisory preview of which mode the live router would lean to for a task.
- **`off | assist | auto`** — set the autonomy leash (delegates to `cdt-config autonomy`).

Present the output plainly. The engines are **on by default** (`autonomy=auto`, teams + scale enabled): the orchestrator escalates to DEPTH/BREADTH freely whenever the work shape benefits. **agent teams** need the experimental flag (`cdt-config teams on` sets it) and **scale mode** needs Claude Code ≥ 2.1.154; if either is missing, escalation falls back to bounded dispatch. The only governor left is a **weekly-budget safety valve** that ASKs (never silently DENYs) as you near the rate-limit ceiling.
